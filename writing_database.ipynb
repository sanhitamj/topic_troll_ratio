That\\u2019s a major war crime. People were hanged for it at Nuremberg. But put that aside.

You\\'re only trying to protect the delicate sensibilities of the radical left who might be led astray by my comments. Because Chomsky is all they\\'ve got. Well, hell. Let\\'s just tell them the truth from a real authority and let them evaluate Chomsky for themselves, shall we?---------Benjamin Kerstein: There are a couple of main points that should be made. First, Chomsky is an absolutely shameless liar. A master of the argument in bad faith. He will say anything in order to get people to believe him. Even worse, he will say anything in order to shut people up who disagree with him. And I\\u2019m not necessarily talking about his public critics. If you\\'ve ever seen how he acts with ordinary students who question what he says, it\\'s quite horrifying. He simply abuses them in a manner I can only describe as sadistic. That is, he clearly enjoys doing it. I don\\'t think anyone ought to be allowed to get away with that kind of behavior.\\nSecond, Chomsky is immensely important to the radical left. When it comes to American foreign policy he isn\\'t just influential, he\\'s basically all they have. Almost any argument made about foreign affairs by the radical left can be traced back to him. That wasn\\'t the case when he started out back in the late \\'60s, but it is now.\\nThird, he is essentially the last totalitarian. Despite his claims otherwise, he\\'s more or less the last survivor of a group of intellectuals who thought systemic political violence and totalitarian control were essentially good things. He babbles about human rights all the time, but when you look at the regimes and groups he\\'s supported, it\\u2019s a very bloody list indeed.\\nCommunism and fascism are obviously dead as the proverbial doornail, but I doubt the totalitarian temptation will ever go away. The desire for unity and a kind of beautiful tyranny seems to spring from somewhere deep in the human psyche.\\nFourth\\u2014and this may be most important\\u2014he makes people stupid. In this sense, he\\'s more like a cult leader or a New Age guru than an intellectual. He allows people to be comfortable with their prejudices and their hatreds, and he undercuts their ability to think in a critical manner. To an extent, this has to do with his use of emotional and moral blackmail. Since he portrays everyone who disagrees with him as evil, if you do agree with him you must be on the side of good and right. This is essentially a kind of secular puritanism, and it\\'s very appealing to many people, for obvious reasons, I think. We all want to think well of ourselves, whether we deserve it or not.\\nThere is an intellectual side to this, as well. You see it clearly in his famous debate with Michel Foucault. Chomsky says at one point that there is a moral and ethical order that is hardwired into human beings. And Foucault basically asks him, why? How do you know this hardwired morality exists? And even if it exists, how can we know that it is, in fact, moral in the first place? We may feel it to be moral, but that doesn\\'t make it true.\\nChomsky\\'s answer is essentially: Because I believe it to be so. Now, whatever that is, it isn\\'t thinking. In fact, it\\'s an excuse for not thinking. Ironically, Chomsky later said that Foucault was the most amoral man he ever met, whereas I would argue that Foucault was simply pointing out that Chomsky\\'s \\u201cmorality\\u201d is in fact a form of nihilism.\\nI think people come to Chomsky and essentially worship him for precisely that reason. He allows them to feel justified in their refusal to think. They never have to ask themselves any difficult questions or provide any difficult answers. It\\u2019s a form of intellectual cowardice essentially, but I\\'m sure you can see its appeal.\\nThis may be one of the reasons for Chomsky\\'s hostility to psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis may be many things, but it is certainly a method of gaining self-knowledge, of asking difficult questions about one\\'s self and others. And that is precisely what he, and his followers, want to avoid.\\nMy apologies for the length of this answer, but I think you\\'ll agree that, of all the bad things people are capable of, their refusal to think is one of the worst, mainly because it leads to most of the other bad things of which they are capable.\\nhttp://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/noam-chomsky-last-totalitarian\\n',\n",

The North, eagerly waiting for provocation, took advantage of the southern attack and, without incitement by the Soviet Union, launched its own strike with the objective of capturing Seoul. Then a massive U.S. intervention followed.\\u201d\\nI'm guessing that the only conclusion you wish to draw from this account is that the Americans and their man Rhee were a bunch of devious, conspiratorial, warmongering miscreants. Fair enough. But if this account is true, then it also illustrates further how incredibly stupid and foolish Kim Il-sung and North Korea's other leaders were at the time. They took the bait and fell right into the trap laid for them by the Americans. \\nIn a political system with any degree of accountability at all, Kim Il-sung would have been removed from power by late 1950 for having so badly miscalculated America's response to seeing South Korea overrun by the DPRK. If Kim Il-sung had truly believed the Americans were a bunch of liars who couldn't be trusted, he never would have accepted at face value (as he apparently did) Secretary of State Dean Acheson's claim in January 1950 that South Korea fell outside of America's defense perimeter.\\n\",\n",

The US area bombed Japan with same objectives, destroy industry and break morale. Every combatant in WW2 bombed civilians. \\nAs a noted before, total war is a war of attrition. You not only have to destroy enemy troops, but you also have to destroy the nation's ability to wage war.

       "  u'\\nSo many on here trying to re-write history and play down USA genocidal actions against North Korea, check this article from the Asia Pacific Journal \\nThe American Air War and the Destruction of North Korea\\nThe Korean War, a \\u201climited war\\u201d for the US and UN forces, was for Koreans a total war. The human and material resources of North and South Korea were used to their utmost. The physical destruction and loss of life on both sides was almost beyond comprehension, but the North suffered the greater damage, due to American saturation bombing and the scorched-earth policy of the retreating UN forces.1 The US Air Force estimated that North Korea\\u2019s destruction was proportionately greater than that of Japan in the Second World War, where the US had turned 64 major cities to rubble and used the atomic bomb to destroy two others. American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea -- that is, essentially on North Korea --including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II.2 The number of Korean dead, injured or missing by war\\u2019s end approached three million, ten percent of the overall population. The majority of those killed were in the North, which had half of the population of the South; although the DPRK does not have official figures, possibly twelve to fifteen percent of the population was killed in the war, a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II.3\\nThe act which inflicted the greatest loss of civilian life in the Korean War by far, one which the North Koreans have claimed ever since was America\\u2019s greatest war crime, was the aerial bombardment of North Korean population centers. American control of the skies over Korea was overwhelming. During the summer and fall, North Korean air defenses were virtually non-existent. Lightly armed, local self-defense units in occupied South Korea could only watch and suffer as their towns and villages were obliterated from the air.5 By the end of the war, North Korea claimed that only two modern buildings remained standing in Pyongyang.\\nFor the Americans, strategic bombing made perfect sense, giving advantage to American technological prowess against the enemy\\u2019s numerical superiority. The American command dismissed British concerns that mass bombardment would turn world opinion against them, insisting that air attacks were accurate and civilian casualties limited.6 Russian accusations of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets did not register with the Americans at all. But for the North Koreans, living in fear of B-29 attacks for nearly three years, including the possibility of atomic bombs, the American air war left a deep and lasting impression. The DPRK government never forgot the lesson of North Korea\\u2019s vulnerability to American air attack, and for half a century after the Armistice continued to strengthen anti-aircraft defenses, build underground installations, and eventually develop nuclear weapons to ensure that North Korea would not find itself in such a position again. The long-term psychological effect of the war on the whole of North Korean society cannot be overestimated. The war against the United States, more than any other single factor, gave North Koreans a collective sense of anxiety and fear of outside threats that would continue long after the war\\u2019s end.\\nNorth Korea\\u2019s considerable economic achievements since liberation were all but completely wiped out by the war. By 1949, after two years of a planned economy, North Korea had recovery from the post-liberation chaos, and economic output had reached the level of the colonial period.7 Plans for 1950 were to increase output again by a third in the North, and the DPRK leadership had expected further economic gains following integration with the agriculturally more productive South after unification. According to DPRK figures, the war destroyed some 8,700 factories, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and 600,000 homes.8 Every significant town, city and industrial area in North Korea had already been bombed. In the spring of 1953, the Air Force targeted irrigation dams on the Yalu River, both to destroy the North Korean rice crop and to pressure the Chinese, who would have to supply more food aid to the North. Five reservoirs were hit, flooding thousands of acres of farmland, inundating whole towns and laying waste to the essential food source for millions of North Koreans.10 Only emergency assistance from China, the USSR, and other socialist countries prevented widespread famine.\\nhttp://apjjf.org/-Charles-K.-Armstrong/3460/article.html\\n',\n",

Or did it deserve its independence and freedom?They (ie USSR and USA, the only ones who mattered in the region) both declared themselves in favour of a free independent Korea. But first they had to get the Japanese out. Hence the agreement that Soviet and US armies would temporarily occupy Korea along the 38th parallel pending the development of an independent state.The trouble was, with the Cold War starting, both sides planned from the start that the \"independent\" state would be under their control.There was brutal violence exercised by both sides against opponents and some pretty large-scale fighting before 1950, as you say.However, there is no doubt, as has been confirmed by the opening up of the Soviet archives, that the Korean War was an act of aggression by North Korea designed to conquer South Korea and forcibly turn it into part of the Communist Empire.\\n',\n",

       "  u'\\n\\nBruce Cumings has made a career of getting North Korea wrong.\\nYet is one of the most commonly cited academics on the matter and not in the derogatory. In fact, he\\'s cited in the essay you link by Shen Zhihua (page 8 of the pdf).\\nThe essay you link, whilst fascinating, also does nothing to counter what Cumings writes above. What it does do is flesh out the Sino-Russian context.\\nIf anyone/thing could be said to have started the Korean war it was the Russian-US split and control of the country. Each country allowing or setting up governments in their respective halves sympathetic to their ideology. Both halves faced mass insurrections and seemingly ignoring the one popular Korean wish at the time for unification. The south was actually occupied by the Americans and had a US military government in the early years. It\\'s not hard to see then the motives for the North to want to remove the occupying power in the South (the memory of Japanese occupation all too fresh) and, favouring it\\'s own brand of governance to that which had been selected for the South.\\nZhihua\\'s essay rather gives the impression that had the North acted sooner, there may have been more popular support, and less resistence, in the South - this in itself is quite interesting.\\nBut the powers behind the split country and their actions that ultimately lead to the war cannot be ignored as the tinder box that fomented, initiated and condoned the conflict.\\nThe Russians were tricksy and the Chinese self serving. The idea that the US were somehow bumbling into the affair with best intentions is completely and utterly laughable though. They were no less self serving and tricksy regarding their occupation of the South.\\nBroad dismissals such as your Castalian, particularly when they contain nonsense McCarthyist language like \"Sympathizer\", are wholly anti intellectual, dishonest and ultimately, dangerous.\\n',\n",

Even Vietnam is being deleted from the national consciousness as will Iraq and Afghanistan. It does not do for the corporate state to let the peasants dwell on failure and lost war in the name of profits. I doubt one American in a thousand would know the US introduced state sponsored terrorism to the post WW2 world with its campaign in Guatemala that killed over 200,000 for a fruit. company. The CIA operative Howard Hunt was only too happy to describe the \"terror campaign\" in Guatemala. The American bubble produced Trump. It not only blinds them to overseas wars in the name of profit but to their own history. In the bubble the west was cowboys and free-enterprise not a big government army exterminating millions to take their land for the settlers. The civil war was a war between valiant brothers rather than the truth - one side was valiant and the other capitalist racist slave traders who would betray and destroy the republic before giving up their crime and lies.Trump has loosed the right wing extremists of the bubble and they have killed a few recently including the young woman in Charlottesville. Blowing up Korea again produces profit and brings the China War one step closer. All aims of the corporate state. Those in the bubble will see what they are told to.

That struggle became an armed one from 1932 onwards.\\nThe US vanquished the Japanese in 1945 and the country was ceded to the USA as part of the surrender terms. Dean Rusk then drew a line at the 38th parallel, artificially dividing the country. This was done due to increasing Russian influence in the northern part of the country and to delineate where communism ended and capitalism commenced. So, despite the Japanese defeat, all Kim Il-sung could do was to start fighting another invader - the USA.\\nFrom 1948-1950, there were open hostilities along the DMZ and both sides made incursions into the other's territory. In the south, the US-backed president, Syngman Rhee, conducted a brutal purge of communists, sympathisers, their families and friends. No-one knows for sure how many were killed or how many simply disappeared, but the numbers are estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

He's betting everything on himself being able to bully Kim into submission. Like he's done so many times in the past, with varying degrees of success in his business ventures. The trouble with that is if he looses this bet he can't just declare bankruptcy for one of his sub-firms. If he looses this bet we have a regional nuclear conflict at best and the start of WWIII at worst. So he's literally betting the fate of millions if not billions of people.

Trump could fire first but then China would find it difficult to not honour the pact with it's ally and would militarily, in some capacity, back Kim. What would result from that? It's a bit doomsday to think of war with China. Terrifying. The question is which one of those will happen? Is Trump goading Kim? Unnecessarily goading him. Is Kim doing the same? It is what he does. It would make the resulting bloodshed from either scenarios nauseous in the extreme if death was all about egos. Then there's Russia.

In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviet Union established a communist government led by Kim Il-sung. The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948, and U.S. troops withdrew in 1949.\\nWith the end of the war with Japan, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Communists and Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with mat\\xe9riel and manpower.\\nThe North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.\\nChina promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea. The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-sung\\u2019s authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il-yu, who was later purged by Kim.\\nBy 1949, South Korean forces had reduced the active number of communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000.\\nKim began seeking Stalin\\u2019s support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to attempt to persuade him.\\nIn April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States.\\nKim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned the U.S. would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.\\nThroughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea.\\nBy mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.\\nIn contrast, the ROK Army defenders were unprepared and ill-equipped. As of 25 June 1950 the ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT6 advanced-trainer airplanes.\\nI'd also like to know why everyone seems to think that it's ok that KJU doesn't just announce that he finally has nukes capable of reaching the US but proceeds to threaten the US repeatedly until DT has to respond.

Mr Cumings then also fails to refer to the attempts by the US and UN to hold a conference on the 23rd to defuse the situation but the North had the conference postponed by a day so that they could conduct a co-ordinated assault on the Pueblo and capture of 82 men who were then tortured and used as bargaining chips. \\nIt is neither useful nor \\u201cedgy\\u201d to heap vitriol on the US in what has become an increasingly publicised trope that puts forward the proposition that the US wants to reignite the Korean War. Contrary to Mr Cumings\\u2019 misleadingly partisan article above the US and South Korea have been given plenty of opportunities to resume war by the continual aggression and incitement from the Kim dynasty \\u2013 to date they have consciously avoiding doing so. The possession of nuclear ICBMs by the North presents a serious risk as they have continually demonstrated that they are willing to attack both South Korean and US personnel (see the shelling of Yeonpyeong and this list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_border_incidents_involving_North_Korea). \\nThe article specifically avoids any reference to the monumental human rights violations of the \\u201cDemocratic\\u201d People's Republic of Korea despite the deaths of millions of its citizens and the estimated 120,000+ people that rot in the regime\\u2019s concentration camps. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-un-excerpts-idUSBREA1G0OF20140217\\nThis has been a lot for people to read so thank you to anyone who has taken the interest to get this far. I am genuinely concerned that the article is both dishonest and destructive as many people will not question the US being responsible for all the world\\u2019s ills. I realise people are busy but it is of paramount importance that we familiarise ourselves with the history of the conflict. In brief: The Korean War began because North Korea together with its Russian allies decided that they would not participate in a free election that was put forward under UN auspices in 1948 to allow the nation\\u2019s people independence, instead they decided to invade South Korea in 1950, less than a year after US forces had departed. This was done with the tacit support of China whom North Korea had supported in the conclusion of its own civil war against the Nationalists. \\nAt the time the US had actually decommissioned the majority of its military since the conclusion of the Second World War as the public did not want to continue paying the vast expenditures necessary for a massive fighting force. This meant that when China\\u2019s armies entered the war to support the North it became a bloody stalemate. Neither side had a decisive edge to bring about victory resulting in the deaths of many innocent civilians on both sides. War is not a game it is a tragedy, innocent people always die. The author\\u2019s clear argument is that the only just course would have been for the US to surrender the South to avoid bloodshed. It is a ridiculous argument; by the same token he, no doubt, would also argue that the Allies ought to have avoided conflict in WWII and surrendered to the Nazis.\\n\",\n",

       "  u'\\n\"Noam Chomsky provides a more dramatic description of the situation: \\u201cWhen US forces entered Korea in 1945, they dispersed the local popular government, consisting primarily of antifascists who resisted the Japanese, and inaugurated a brutal repression, using Japanese fascist police and Koreans who had collaborated with them during the Japanese occupation. About 100,000 people were murdered in South Korea prior to what we call the Korean War, including 30-40,000 killed during the suppression of a peasant revolt in one small region, Cheju Island.\\u201d\\nIn sharp contrast to its position on Japan and Germany, Washington wanted the (Western dominated) UN to take responsibility for Korea in 1947. The Soviets objected, claiming the international organization had no jurisdiction over post- WWII settlement issues (as the US had argued for Germany and Japan). Instead, Moscow proposed that all foreign forces withdraw from Korea by January 1948. Washington demurred, convincing member states to create the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to organize elections in the part of Korea occupied by the US. For its part, the Soviet bloc boycotted UNTCOK. Canada joined UNTCOK even though Prime Minister Mackenzie King noted privately \\u201cthe [US] State Department was simply using the United Nations as an arm of that office to further its own policies.\\u201d\\nThe UN sponsored election in South Korea led to the long-term division of that country and Canada\\u2019s involvement in a conflict that would cause untold suffering. On May 10, 1948 the southern part of Korea held UNTCOK sponsored elections. In the lead-up to the election leftwing parties were harassed in a campaign to \\u201cremove Communism\\u201d from the south. As a result leftwing parties refused to participate in elections \\u201cwrought with problems\\u201d that \\u201cprovoked an uprising on the island of Cheju, off Korea\\u2019s southern coast, which was brutally repressed.\\u201d\\nAfter the poll Canada was among the first countries to recognize the Republic of Korea in the south, effectively legitimizing the division of the country. External Affairs minister Lester Pearson sent Syngman Rhee, who became president, a note declaring \\u201cfull recognition by the Government of Canada of the Republic of Korea as an independent sovereign State with jurisdiction over that part of the Korean peninsula in which free elections were held on May 10 1948, under the observation of the United Nations Temporary Commission.\\u201d Conversely, Ottawa refused to recognize the North, which held elections after the South, and opposed its participation in UNTCOK reports. For Pearson the South held \\u201cfree elections\\u201d while those in the North \\u201chad not been held in a democratic manner\\u201d since the Soviets did not allow UNTCOK to supervise them. After leaving office Pearson contradicted this position, admitting \\u201cRhee\\u2019s government was just as dictatorial as the one in the North, just as totalitarian. Indeed, it was more so in some ways.\\u201d\\nThe official story is that the Korean War began when the Soviet-backed North invaded the South on June 25, 1950. The US then came to the South\\u2019s aid. As is the case with most official US history the story is incomplete, if not downright false. Korea: Division, Reunification, and US foreign Policy notes: \\u201cThe best explanation of what happened on June 25 is that Syngman Rhee deliberately initiated the fighting and then successfully blamed the North. The North, eagerly waiting for provocation, took advantage of the southern attack and, without incitement by the Soviet Union, launched its own strike with the objective of capturing Seoul. Then a massive U.S. intervention followed.\\u201d (Global Research)\\n',\n",

Though the northern areas had been largely won back by indigenous partisan fighters backed by China and Russia the southern region had still been in control of the Imperial Japanese army until they surrendered to the US. The US then used Japanese troops to control the southern region until then could step in and install a puppet regime. The reason the southern region had no army is because they had not established a fighting force in combat with Imperial Japan and so when the Japanese surrendered there was a vacuum. The US tried to step in to that vacuum and impose a US solution, which was rejected by the Koreans and the US then had to launch a full scale invasion, strong-arming the UN to provide international legitimacy. It was similar in Vietnam where the Brits went in and took the Japanese surrender and then used the defeated Japanese troops as a surrogate UK force to keep order against the mounting indigenous resistance until the 'democratic' Imperial French Army could step back in.

      "comment_text [u'\\nComments on this thread will close shortly. Thanks for your contributions.\\n', u'\\nBut for all the hyperbole, its not a \"ban on muslims\", there are more muslim majority countries NOT on the list than are on it. \\nSo all the overblown hyperbole is nauseating shit stirring by the \"we hate Trump\" crew and \"the system was fine until our candidate lost\" brigade.\\nAnd like or loathe Trump he certainly has taken action.\\n', u'\\nCaption to the photo at the top of the article:May: \"Please Mr Trump, say you will deal with me! I have nobody else. I will do whatever you ask, please!\"Trump: \"You could start by kneeling down and kissing my oversized 100% American arse\"\\n', u\"\\nI see the dog whistle has sounded.A few bus loads of commenters who share Trump's vile views have rushed into the breach, and why not, there is now a far right wing racist troll in the Oval Office.The big white leader is calling them all from under their stones to bask in his orange glow.\\n\", u\"\\nDoucheBlog, I wonder what they're saying behind closed doors in the BofE and Wall St. That's where the chit chat is real. Trump + May = Puppet\\n\", u\"\\nI don't think that Britain is in any position to criticise another country about who it lets in. When you look at how the UK has allowed itself to become a safe haven for Islamists to hide out and organise from.\\nTheresa May spent a good part of her time as Home Secretary trying to get rid of Abu Qatada and has only just prosecuted Anjem Choudhary although he has linked with many terrorists both here and abroad.\\n\", u\"\\nWhat a completely ridiculous stance the lefties are taking over Trump's temporary ban. What about the border fences going up in Europe to keep migrants out? Why aren't the lefties up in arms about these poor people being prevented from finding their way to a free land where money grows on trees? The mass deportations that are going on? These lefties must be ignored and Trump and the USA allowed to get on and do what they think is best for their country.\\n\", u\"\\nWell, yes, but that's hardly the Final Solution , is it? Elfin's right - the reaction is out of all proportion.\\n\", u\"\\nNo that isn't the reason, otherwise Saudi would be on the 'banned' list, especially seeing as they sponsor ISIS.None of the countries on the list have exported terrorism to the US, Saudi has.In fact Iranians and Iraqi/Syrian Kurds are fighting ISIS but those countries are on the banned list.Still, the US does business with Saudi, as does Trump.\\n\", u'\\nBut do you really want to deal with Trump? The only way of dealing that Trump accepts is where he comes up on top and shafts the other guy. Do you suggest that we should go to the US and beg for a deal, no matter how much we have to compromise to get it? How far do you think we should go to get a deal? Send in prostitutes? Give Trump cash in brown envelopes under the table? Give Trump the right of first night over our nubile females? Have him grope the Queen?\\n', u'\\nStop being so melodramatic. He/she is merely pointing out that there is always other options if you really do have such a poor opinion of where you currently reside. Have to say I thought it was excellent advice.\\n', u'\\nJust received a BNP mailshot. They seem to be targeting the merry brexiteers of Lincolnshire. Their political wish list seems to have been written by Donald Trump.They must feel very chuffed that their ideas have gone totally mainstream.\\n', u'\\nIslamic extremism is GLOBAL politics ?\\n', u\"\\nThat isn't the point - do try and keep up.\\n\", u'\\nWill they? Then he had better build his wall quickly!\\n', u'\\nI was not \"moaning\". Read it again.\\n', u'\\nLet me get this right. Obama tells the UK to get to the end of the line. Trump says go to the head of the line. The UK has a testy negotiation ahead with the EU. And it has nothing better to do than opine on domestic US politics. Principle is very important until you run out of principal.\\n', u\"\\nbut he's got orange disease ?http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140914-florida-orange-citrus-greening-gmo-environment-science/\\n\", u\"\\nHow are the expats in Spain Fred? Have any got any nails left to bite? It's bad enough here, must be awful being in limbo, in a slightly more comfy version of the people refused entry to the USA. Hope it works out for our EU expats!\\n\", u'\\nBut islamic extremists are the reason for the travel ban....\\n', u'\\nThat depends on your definition of immigrants: are we talking first, second or third generation? \\nTrump campaigned on a \"total ban on Muslims entering the USA\" and Trump won. If Muslims are unhappy, Muslims perhaps need to put their own house in order.\\n', u\"\\n\\nWow, looking at the flurry of right-wing Trump apologists and bully-boys on here lately, I can't decide what is more cretinous, trolling for free or trolling for cash.\\n\\nI think the reason is that you can type as much as you like, be fairly rude, you need not make sense, and it is free of charge.\\nI mean why would you pay to use the Telegraph when you can dump your brain on here, or why be limited to 150 characters on the BBC where you can't even swear or insult people?\\nSo this becomes the forum of choice, even for people who aren't really Guardian types. I think we should have extreme vetting of cif members, and any who formerly read any of the 7 most deadly right wing rags, e.g Daily Heil, Torygraph, should be banned from cif!\\n\", u'\\nYes Let May carry on Playing the Strumpet for donald.\\n', u'\\nWho are you to think you should tell the PM what she should do? Diplomacy comes in all forms which you are not aware of. Trump is enacting what he promised those who voted. Now where were the protesters when Christians were and are being targeted by Muslims?\\n', u\"\\nIf the extremist travels so freely between countries, then why not ban Saudi Arabia and Egypt, too? It doesn't make sense, unless there is something in it for Trump and his cronies. Just as there was with Bush and his cronies.\\n\", u\"\\nCalm down. It's a television drama.And the best reason why you needn't take it so seriously is that former real hostage John McCarthy, has said that it has fatal flaws in how it demonstrates how a hostage would actually feel & behave following release. It's just a drama. It relies on provoking responses to be commercially successful. That isn't the same thing as attempting to be honest and present it accurately.\\n\", u\"\\nI wonder what is being said behind closed doors in Buckingham Palace. Come to think of it, I don't have to wonder. Every generation of the royal family has a reason to despise him.\\n\", u\"\\nDon't believe a word Johnson says. He has a track record in mendacity and being economical with the truth; a needy narcissist with an overwhelming desire to be loved, admired and adulated.\\n\", u'\\nQuarantine Ebola May!\\n', u\"\\nNow that Theresa may is on such good terms with Trump,I don't expect her to condemn any of Trump's actions.With all the arrogance that she treated her European partners withover Brexit, she has so few friends left that the UK now largelydepends on the goodwill of the US and its government.\\n\", u\"\\nAre you uttering a veiled threat? Is this a fulmination? Since then I'm going to register you with your IP address.\\n\", u\"\\nTo be good they have to be somewhat close to being truthful. That one isn't.\\n\", u\"\\nWhich Americans feel threatened by Islamic extremism? 9/11 was lead by people from Saudi Arabia but Saudi isn't on the list. Nor is Egypt or Pakistan. There have been no recorded terrorist incidents (Islamic extremist or not) carried out by immigrants to the USA. Gun toting Americans perhaps killed many!\\n\", u\"\\n\\nSuper Callous Fragile Racist Sexist Nazi Potus\\n\\nVery good.....even though the sound of it is something quite attrocious, if you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious, Super Callous Fragile Racist Sexist Nazi Potus!\\n\", u\"\\nRather than invite Trump to tea and sanswiches with the Queen, Theresa May should break off diplomatic relations with the US until they can find a human being to inhabit the White House. I'm astonished that so many people can't recognise a dangerous megalomaniac when they see one. Would you have him to tea?\\n\", u'\\nBeing a friend of America is not the same as being a friend of Trump.\\n', u'\\nBut all of the countries \"restricted\" do contain islamic fanatics and unfortunately they are able to move rather easily between these same muslim countries. Trump\\'s action is clumsy and probably rather ineffective but there is nothing unreasonable about it in principle. Many of those who have carried out terrorist attacks in the west may have had their origins in, for example, Saudi Arabia, but they have often travelled to the west by very circuitous routes and with the connivance of religious fanatics in the countries listed in the ban.\\n', u'\\nTake a good long look in the mirror. Maybe they think the same or worse about you.\\n', u\"\\nHomeland's back and I tried watching it and couldn't. The producers had no idea that Trump would be elected. The very idea. As if such a nonsense could ever happen. So the series has a female president and a storyline which, when it was written, couldn't have imagined the shitstorm we're facing. We haven't gone back to the 80s, we're in the 60s.\\n\", u'\\nbut surely a terrorist would just go to Mexico and walk across the as yet still open border ?\\n', u'\\nI normally don\\'t like pisstake politician names like \"Bliar\", but that one was pretty good.\\n', u\"\\nGood point. By the way I'm not hating, I'm just stating the recent events. But it's also a fact that about 100% of Trump's government is white and therefore obviously mostly members of former European immigrants. So I guess some of them are nowadays still part of WASP and also a few are of Irish catholic offspring, like Bannon or Kellyanne Conway.\\n\", u\"\\nThis temporary US travel ban leads to a world wide uproar. You can protest all you want but it's seems to me a rather hypocritical knee-jerk reaction. But non Muslims are all too familiar with travel bans in certain Islamic countries. Furthermore, discrimination and persecution of, and even violence against non muslims is commonplace in quite a few Islamic countries. These serious issues are rarely addressed or have led to worldwide indignation.\\n\", u\"\\n'Landslide'?! He won by one of the smallest electoral college margins in history and he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes!\\n#AlternativeFacts\\nhttp://heavy.com/news/2016/11/donald-trump-electoral-college-victory-margin-lead-over-hillary-clinton-landslide-blowout-historic-kellyanne-conway-comparison-other-elections-list-electors-margin/\\n\", u'\\nHow is \"it\\'ll encourage terrorism\" an argument in favour of anything?\\n', u'\\nYup! It really is time auntie was given her marching orders.\\n', u'\\nguess Syria must be worse ? HUH ?\\n', u\"\\n(( with no disrespect to the boys who died in Vietnam ,but let's face it ,that wasn't rocket science was it ))\\n\", u'\\nPutin bots, Trampists and Kippers: the scourge of humankind\\n', u'\\nSpecial decoder ring that used to come in specially marked boxes of breakfast cereal.\\n', u\"\\nPerhaps MP Nadhim Zahawi would like to explain why he deleted this tweet.Nadhim Zahawi (Conservative) retweeted @nadhimzahawi :RT @nadhimzahawi: Every country must control its borders, but Trump's ban is counterproductive and wrong - my piece for @guardian https://t\\u2026Is all OK now he knows he's OK? Typical fecking Tory.\\n\", u'\\nSeriously! Do you actuaiiy buy any of that guff? Trudeau has to be just about the most insincere politician on the planet.\\n', u'\\nI think we are missing something here. Americans feel threatended by Islamic extremism and this was a factor in Trump winning the election. Trump has not banned all Muslims - Saidi Arabia and Egypt do not feature in the banned list - and his ban extends to all people, irrespective of religion, from the named countries. This is not as it is being presented, therefore. There is no discrimination against Muslims per se, Trump has just said that the seven named countries pose a threat to US citizens at the moment. It is rather like the Ebola quarantine. Nobody was saying that everybody had ebola, just that everybody form the infected countries had to be carefully screened before being allowed to enter.\\n', u\"\\nIt's only been a week into the Presidency. The whole world is watching.\\n\", u'\\nWhoops, correction, meant to say that the US sells arms to Saudi and Trump has business interests out there.Bit of Freudian slip.\\n', u\"\\n\\n-We're not living in 2001. Saudi is not the exporter of most terrorist attacks today, at all. In fact the states made subject to Trump's ban are, and have been for some time.\\n\\nActually, wrong, Saudi sponsors ISIS, neither Iran or Iraq do, yet Saudi isn't on the list but both Iraq and Iran are, and here is the clincher both Iranian, and Iraqi Kurds are amongst the only ones actually fighting ISIS.Saudi sponsors not only ISIS but the Taliban as well, so how you believe they are not exporters of terrorism anymore is beyond me.However, the US does sell arms to ISIS, and Trump has business interests out there.Could that possibly be the reason do you think?\\n\", u'\\nThe squeezed middle....but to be apathetic or complacent in an age of turmoil can itself be a form of extremism.\\n', u'\\nMay, the Farce be with you:- Boris not Good Enough, Wee Liam and the Slack Eyed Me-Me-Me\\'s and Phil Hammond-Organ.\\nIt\\'s all Dave \"I\\'m off now!\" Cameron\\'s fault, this Brickshit House of Commons.\\n', u'\\nThe muslim countries should kick out all americans..which i think they are planning..two can play his game...how are americans going to work on oil biz over in these countries. They are shooting themselces in the foot.\\n', u\"\\nIf Trump's USA was really as bad as the media describes refugees would be fleeing for their lives not clamouring to get in.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nAs a friend of America, Theresa May must condemn Trump\\u2019s travel ban\\n\\nShe isn't going to. It isn't going to happen. Mrs May has far too much political capital tied up in her 'special relationship', she has a State visit to think about, and she needs the Trade deals. \\nOne way for to you help Sir is to vote against A50, because if it were not for brexit, she would not have gone gallivanting over to Washington in a bums rush in the first place. She would not have invited a bloke who had already promised to do exactly what he has done for a State visit after only a few days in office. It has never happened before. No sensible person would do it, unless they were desperate. Very desperate.\\nIf I were you I would quit the Tories and switch to Labour. You might start a trend, and you would certainly make a statement. As a Tory MP, you wont much cut much ice with either side by writing in The Guardian.\\nStill, at least you made an effort.\\n\", u'\\n\"What the duly elected leader of the US wants to do to try and protect his people...\"\\nThe 7 countries \"banned\" from allowing the \"bad dudes\" (Trump\\'s quote, not mine) entry, have never attacked the US. One of two countries not affected by the ban, Saudi Arabia, actually did have terrorists come to the US and caused death and destruction, but they are not considered a threat. Boy that decision makes sense. Not. So what is Trump\\'s true underlying motive?\\nIt\\'s the same slight of hand lie George Bush used to invade Iraq; we\\'re going after the \"bad dudes\", when what we really did is use taxpayer funded muscle to protect the resources thieves.\\nWhen something does not make sense, always, follow the money.\\n', u\"\\nZahawi is a pro-welfare cuts, pro-Brexit, pro-small government, oil company boss Tory MP. Calling him 'liberal-left' is surely the most alternative of facts!\\n\", u\"\\nMaybe they hate Islam and are wary of Muslims because they've done some research into what Islam actually stands for and it disgusts them?\\n\", u\"\\nWow, looking at the flurry of right-wing Trump apologists and bully-boys on here lately, I can't decide what is more cretinous, trolling for free or trolling for cash.Frankly, what's in it for you either way? I thought the right had won the argument and the rest of us had to adjust to the new swivel-eyed paradigm. What are you all so insecure about that you need to drown out all discussion everywhere?\\n\", u'\\nTrump has caused such pain to the illiberal and intolerant that the rest of us are becoming Trump fans.\\n', u'\\nThat makes no sense\\n', u'\\n\"I read somewhere that in the UK, the demographic of those signing the petition is about the same as that voting remain for the UK Brexit\"\\nWhat crap, nobody knows who voted for Brexit nor is the demographic of the muppets who clicked on the silly poll known.\\n', u\"\\nThe worrying thing is that Trump excites most Alpha males as he is the lead bully. I get caught up thinking yeh, fuck em, but then I draw breath and realise what a shit storm is coming thanks to the lean of the common man and woman to the far right. The thing is we are not going to be able to stop it now , I don't think. Very sad. It's like a collective madness has descended. Ps I have no time for Islam or any other sky fairy worship. Talk about dividing humanity .........\\n\", u\"\\nThat's a fair point but also doesn't address the arguments.\\n\", u'\\nProtection against people from countries that have not mounted a single attack in the US for forty years.\\n', u\"\\nVery real suffering for people whose relatives were detained or who still don't know if they can go back to their course of study.\\n\", u'\\nFor the first time in forever I find myself in total agreement with every word of an article written by a Conservative MP. Wonders will never cease!\\n', u'\\nHe is doing what he said he was going to do and he got elected.\\nWho elected you as the voice of Britain?\\n', u\"\\nand will pour fuel on the fire of extremism\\nSo let me get this straight: a democratically elected head of state cannot do what he was elected to do for fear it might up Islamic terrorists? \\nIsn't that actually an argument in support of what Trump has done?\\n\", u\"\\nThis is a intelligent, nuanced piece making the case for a tolerant and generous approach to immigration. It's just a shame that the author has taken such a different line to economic and social issues at home; he has repeatedly spoken in favour of cuts to welfare and social spending with little apparent sympathy for the victims of the same.

That's not a blas\\xe9 comment - several of my country's Poole with terrorism conviction charges found a warm welcome whenever they went to NY, Boston and other places, where extensive fundraising 'for the cause' continued for many, many a long year (and still does, to a degree) courtesy of that most curious of beasts: the 'Irish-American', whose blood dollars helped fuel murder and mayhem on My island for a very long time.\\nBut, of course, everybody loves The Irish - a great bunch of lads - and we enjoyed, and still do, a disproportionate amount of power across the pond that 'mere' Muslims don't.\\nThus, enthusiastic sectarian bigotry and overt racism has been given free reign by our hypocritical (cough) partners over the sea, who're suddenly willing to bully refugees and children with a concerned tweet or two about 'bad dudes', in ways they wouldn't dream about others who've got a different grip over American politics.\\n\", u'\\nThe TRUTH the real hard to handle truth is Americans approve of Trump, (Rasmussen, You Gov) media selectively focusing on other polls. \\nKeep going Don your tweets are the real source of news!\\nIgnore liberal big city coastal elites. The masses in US and UK support what your doing.\\n', u\"\\nValues are under threat here.Not sure what sort of values these are but apparently folk get steamed up over 'em.\\n\", u'\\n\\nPerhaps also then look at nations where these terrorists originate from\\n\\nLike the UK, France, Belgium?\\n', u\"\\nSo you'd like to extend it to more countries?\\n\", u\"\\nAs Patrick Cockburn points out here, Trump's disastrous ban is going to increase terrorism and further undermine community relations globally.\\n\", u\"\\nSo appease people who threaten to kill you if you don't let them into your home?\\n\", u\"\\nProblem is he got a far from emphatic mandate. In fact more American's didn't vote for him than did. Granted, i am aware of how the Electoral College system works and I am aware that he won the election fair and square, but it was a million miles from a cut and dry 80-20 split 'we are all behind you mr president fill your boots' election result.\\nIn fact the build up to the election, the outcry since the result and everything that has happened since should have made it very clear to the president that a very sizeable percentage of americans are terrified of his policies, his ideals and his stated approach. And one might have suggested that if he really was a president for 'all americans' that he at least get his feet under the table and gain a degree of trust before signing 27 executive orders, alienating half the population of the world and plunging the entire world into political turmoil 2 weeks into his reign. \\nAdmittedly I am watching from afar and only know what the media is telling me - but either way it is scary.....\\n\", u'\\nI love the Gruandian opinion pieces,even though I pay for a proper paper (The Times) they make me smile probably 95% of the time.I have been a Graun reader for 30 odd years and we have never been further apart,than over the last decade or so.\\n', u\"\\nDear President Trump,\\nI think it's about time we quit being pushed around by other countries and start up our thermonuclear testing. It's been years since we've tested a w-device of any stripe, and we need to show our will to the world that we can develop these weapons further. \\nCanceling the neutron bomb was also a big mistake, one that should be corrected right away. There are lots of natural resources we can get out of the ground with a neutron bomb which won't be affected by the radiation at all. There are only minor concerns with above ground short term health problems, but, we can wait to send our own people in. Foreigners can do the initial work and take the brunt of the health problems from, let's say, working an oil field after a neutron eviction event, why send and risk Americans?\\nAlso, you've been going far too easy on the government, you need to get harder and more decisive. This wallowing around junk is just getting on everyone's nerves. The wall has to go up right away, and the foreigners need to be shut out immediately. They're not going to make American Great, Americans are going to do that. \\nGet the nuke testing going right away, get rid of any scientist, lawyer, reporter, or politician that stands in the way of progress and the American will, and stop this indecisive wallowing around. Strike a blow for Americans, again and again, the hammer of Freedom needs to ring out over and over again, and much more loudly. \\nOur will rings triumphant over everything!\\n\", u'\\n\"All evidence\"?\\n', u'\\nSpot the difference between \"a group of immigrants\" and entire countries\\' worth, genius.\\n', u'\\nI\\'m not Trump, how can I answer? I don\\'t even support him. But I\\'d guess that, as I indicated, he just renewed the order Obama already issued years ago. \\nAnd for what it\\'s worth \\u2013 again, not defending Saudi here \\u2013 the whole \"the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi\" canard is stupid. They weren\\'t trained there, were they? They didn\\'t meet there, did they? It had very little at all to do with Saudi Arabia.\\n', u'\\nIt was a six month travel ban on Iraqis. Check your own sources.\\n', u'\\nIs it safe to go near an airport today, will I be accosted by the permanently offended, virtue signalling? \\nYou want to become a millionaire between now and 2025, knock out some Trump effigies, set up stall outside the USA embassy or Airports, a tenner a pop\\n', u\"\\nI'm sure she's aware there's a majority of ill-informed reactionaries in the country. It's why she's a Tory.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump continues to fuel xenophobia unabated outside of logic or decency. He is his 'self-fulfilling prophecy'.\\n\", u\"\\nwhat do you mean 'push them into extremism'? What is the reason this happens to muslims, but isn't the default setting for other religions? And what is Trump's holy war you refer to? Which parties will be taking part?\\n\", u'\\nObviously. Maybe you were gardening?\\n', u'\\nPerhaps you need to check the definition of \"landslide\".\\n', u'\\nThe people have delivered their verdict on this question already via an election so all this second-guessing by the bourgeoisie, whilst fascinating as a further illustration of their over-weening arrogance, is rather beside the point.\\n', u\"\\nHmmm, are these the talking points you're being told to use? They've all been debunked already, please report back to Breitbart to get an update.\\n\"]\n",

Saturday I was told that I would be one of those that Donald Trump had decided were unfit to even visit America. Although I am British, and do not hold dual nationality, the so-called <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/trump-immigration-ban-syria-muslims-reaction-lawsuits\" title=\"\">Muslim ban</a> refers to individuals\\u2019 country of origin, and I was born in Iraq.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>I was relieved to know by the end of Sunday that the British government and Foreign Office, led by Boris Johnson, had clarified that there would be <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/30/boris-johnson-trump-ban-british-passport-holders-video\" title=\"\">exemptions for holders of British passports</a>. However, that work does not make President Trump\\u2019s ill-thought-out policy any more bearable. And the assurances given to me and those like me have not removed a nagging doubt that we are no longer welcome in America.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>My father made the decision to flee with my family after Saddam Hussein started his brutal oppression of the Kurdish people. Instead of facing a life of suffering I was welcomed into our wonderful country. I have been proud to call the UK home ever since, and what better form of acceptance is there than the people of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/24/tory-mp-nadhim-zahawi-lands-job-with-oil-firm-gulf-keystone\" title=\"\">Stratford-on-Avon voting for me</a> to represent them as a community and be their voice in parliament?</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>In truth I have always previously felt accepted wherever I have found myself in the western world, and I have always enjoyed my visits to America. My twin sons were delighted to win places to study at Princeton, and have been excited to seize this opportunity to attend one of the greatest universities in the world. Last year one of my boys had a life-threatening illness, and like any parents we dropped everything to be with him. This weekend we had to face the possibility that we may not be able to do so again. It is so sad that the president of that great nation, which should be a beacon of freedom in an often dark world, had \\u2013 until the intervention of our government \\u2013 decided that for my boys, their mum and dad were unfit to enter his country.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Immigration will always be a controversial subject, and it is wholly legitimate for countries to control their borders, set rules on who is welcome to stay or visit and enforce compliance with these laws. Last year America tightened up its visa rules, and so my wife and I had to attend the American embassy for an interview. This was an uncomfortable experience, but entirely understandable. If you were about to let someone in your house, then you would most likely want to know who they were.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>There will always be hoops through which to jump when travelling, and it is fair and right that they should be created, as a democratically elected government sees fit. However, Trump\\u2019s actions are not analogous to the creation of an extra hoop. He has not created an extra test that those who share my country of birth must navigate to prove that they are law-abiding, decent citizens who wish to access his country. Instead he has just removed their ability to even try.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>This isn\\u2019t about getting tough on immigration; the president has in effect stated that there is nothing those from these Muslim-majority countries can do or say to prove that they are acceptable visitors to the United States of America \\u2013 the land of the free.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>I am lucky enough to have a platform from which to condemn this move, as a politician and a successful businessman, even if it appears no longer to directly affect me. Yesterday I, alongside Labour\\u2019s Ed Miliband, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/boris-johnson-to-face-mps-over-uk-exemptions-to-us-travel-ban\" title=\"\">put forward a motion for an emergency debate in parliament</a>. I am so proud that my fellow members of parliament <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/nadhimzahawi/status/826175942548664320\" title=\"\">voted unanimously</a> in favour of urging the US government to repeal this counterproductive ban. The response from ordinary people in Britain has also been so heartening.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>As Theresa May rightly said when she met Trump last week, we must tackle the ugly extremism of Islamic State and its ideological bedfellows. We must be tough on the threats to our citizens, and that means that we must control our borders. But to defeat that evil we should also be building and strengthening our relationships with allies and friends in the region, not cutting ourselves off from them. After all, the vast <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/18/pakistan-attack-reveals-the-truth-about-terrorism-it-kills-more-poor-muslims-than-rich-westerners\" title=\"\">majority of victims of terrorism around the world are Muslims</a>, caught in the midst of terror as they just try to go about their daily lives. The world we all wish to see is one that is safer for everyone: not a world from which we must cower behind a permanently raised drawbridge. That is not the action of strength. It is the action of ignorance, fear and weakness.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Our prime minister also said last week that part of being a good friend to America, and its new president, was <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38710225\" title=\"\">pointing out when he was wrong</a>. With this ban he has strayed far from what is acceptable, and so far from what our shared values require. Indeed, he has probably poured fuel on the fire of extremism, and created enemies, rather than winning friends. It is right for our government to say this loud and clear.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The US should be a shining example of how to deliver government for the people, of the people and by the people. A country that is governed by the rule of law, fair and equal to all. A country that where, if you play by the rules, you will be treated in the same way as every other person, regardless of race, religion or creed. This executive order is entirely in contravention of the founding principles of that nation, and it is rightly being condemned.

Someone like the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff might prove to be a cooler head on questions of war and peace than the chairman of a website that is beloved by neo-Nazis.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>This is no time to be stoking the fires of intolerance, as the premier of Qu\\xe9bec, Philippe Couillard, explained. \\u201cWe live in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite. Our country, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada</a> and Qu\\xe9bec, has to remain a beacon of tolerance.\\u201d</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>That beacon of tolerance is still shining at the grassroots in the United States. After its mosque was mysteriously burned to the ground over the weekend, a small Muslim community in Victoria, Texas, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/texas-mosque-fund-raiser.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F01%2F30%2Fus%2Ftexas-mosque-fund-raiser.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">has raised </a>more than $900,000 online for its reconstruction. The founder of the mosque said local churches and a synagogue had offered space for the community to continue its prayers.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>These are the people Donald Trump should be listening to, much like the protesters who are filling the streets of America\\u2019s cities, large and small.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But if he won\\u2019t listen to the people, he might as well listen to his most obvious predecessor. Because there is a model for his own redemption, and his name was George Wallace.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Trump may have campaigned by vilifying Mexicans and Muslims, and he may have started his presidency the same way. But George Wallace campaigned with a similar tone and substance, and late in life, he renounced segregation and asked for forgiveness from African Americans.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Trump could grow into his presidency by leading the far-right away from violence, condemning his KKK supporters and denouncing racist murderers. He could seek forgiveness from Muslim Americans by personally apologizing to the Iraqi interpreter who was <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/iraqi-immigrant-donald-trump-airport-detention.html\">detained</a> for 19 hours at JFK airport despite having risked his life working for the 101st airborne division for a decade.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But of course, he won\\u2019t. Donald Trump is too weak, too foolish and too chaotic to see beyond the immediate crises he has created.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>How foolish is he? On Sunday night he issued a press statement insisting \\u201cthis is not a Muslim ban\\u201d and that he has \\u201ctremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria\\u201d.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>By the next morning, he was tweeting something completely different. \\u201cThis was a big part of my campaign,\\u201d he <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/826044059647107073\">explained</a>, quite possibly on his unsecured Android phone. \\u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \\u2018bad\\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \\u2018dudes\\u2019 out there!\\u201d</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Taken at his infantile word, Trump literally makes no sense: having campaigned on a Muslim ban, Trump now believes he has taken all those bad dudes by surprise with the same ban.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>As written by a nine-year-old boy, in an imaginary game of Ruler of the Free World, this might be mildly entertaining. But we\\u2019re actually talking about a 70-year-old commander-in-chief, who is willing to fire dissenting officials, such as his <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"

\\u2013 with amazement and concern \\u2013 from Europe, the events of the past 24 hours have an obvious explanation. The Americans elect a reality TV star to the highest office in the land, and this is what they get: an individual as strong-willed, deed-driven and capricious as his media persona, who hesitates not a moment before telling a senior law officer who has crossed him that <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/justice-department-trump-immigration-acting-attorney-general-sally-yates\">she is fired</a>.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But something more interesting \\u2013 and perhaps in the end more productive \\u2013 is surely going on. What we are watching, while resembling in many ways reality TV, is an accelerated, distilled working out of the US constitution \\u2013 a constitution that this untutored president is stress-testing to its limits.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>The dismissal of Sally Yates from her post as acting attorney general is just the latest, nor will it be the last of the crisis points. In a small way, it illustrates an abiding weakness of the US electoral system, where the transition is never really complete by the time the new president is inaugurated.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>By rights, Yates should already have been replaced by Trump\\u2019s nominee for attorney general, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/19/jeff-sessions-terrifying-prospect-black-americans\">Jeff Sessions</a>. But while some Trump nominees thought to be problematical have sailed through their congressional hearings, the confirmation of Sessions \\u2013 an ardent foe of illegal immigration among other things \\u2013 has been held up. Trump has thus been deprived of an obedient attorney general at the very time he most needs one.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Yates, as an Obama appointee, was hardly going to find herself in tune with an edict that amounts to a blanket exclusion of seven countries\\u2019 nationals. The only surprise, perhaps, is that she went so far as to use her \\u201cacting\\u201d power to oppose this executive order. What is more, she put her objections in writing, advising Justice Department lawyers that the new president\\u2019s instruction order should not be defended in the courts and was quite probably unlawful.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>It has been easy, during Trump\\u2019s first helter-skelter week, to gain the impression that a US president has the power effectively to rule by decree. As <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38695593\">executive order</a> followed executive order \\u2013 the majority, it appeared, composed by clever lawyers to minimise legal difficulties \\u2013 there seemed to be almost no practical constraints on what the president could do. So long as the orders were restricted to policy and required no spending subject to congressional approval, Trump seemed to have a clear run.<br/></p>', u'\\n', u'<p>All right, so \\u201cthe people\\u201d \\u2013 or some of them \\u2013 came out to protest: the women\\u2019s march on the day after his inauguration, and the spontaneous protests at airports across the country as the effects of the seven-country ban started to make themselves felt. But Trump dismissed these furious bursts of dissent with little more than a wave of the hand.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>He has tried the same with Yates \\u2013 removing her and drafting in Dana Boente, US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, in her stead. Trump may try to send a reinforcing message when he announces his nominee for the supreme court today. But, together with the actions of a federal judge, who <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/federal-judge-stays-deportations-trump-muslim-executive-order\">blocked</a> part of the immigration order on Sunday, the episode represents a widening faultline within and across the different branches of government.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Appointees may be political, but most judges are no pushovers \\u2013 especially in matters of the constitution. So the duel between the new president, his judges, and principled servants of the executive branch, is likely to go on. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>In one way, the eruption of such a conflict so early in the Trump administration is disconcerting, especially for those in Europe not used to such tussles. While it exposes some of the weakness of the US system, however, it also highlights some of its strengths. There are real constraints on presidential power; a US president cannot rule by decree.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But each president is free to test those limits. And the people, by choosing to protest or acquiesce, have a role, too. Trump is forcing the United States to define itself; to decide anew what is acceptable and what not. That feels dangerous. But it also feels exhilarating, and it is not necessarily a bad thing. </p>', u'\\n', u'<div class=\"submeta\">\\n\\n<div class=\"submeta__section-labels\">\\n<ul class=\"submeta__links\">\\n<li

We will be at war within 6 months. But there will be no war crimes trials, no hangings in Spandau for these criminals. This time the Nazis have military power that Hitler could not even dream of. It is a real life nightmare. And these men a curse for their nation and the world.\\n', u'\\nComments on this thread will close shortly. Thanks for your contributions.\\n', u'\\nBullshit. Trump has the lowest approval ratings of any President EVER.\\n', u'\\nAnd the quote about being a self professed Leninist, intent on destroying \"all of today\\'s establishment\". Shouldn\\'t that be enough of an indication? Do you think you will be safe in this fear based new world order? Do you think you will be given special privilege? All of us will have to contend with the fall out from what is without question a coup.\\n', u\"\\n\\nA not particularly tough measure is introduced to try and prevent mass murder,\\n\\nGo ahead then!\\nTell us how many Syrians, Yemenis, Somalis, Iraqis, Iranians, Libyans or Sudanese have murdered any Americans on US soil since 1975?It's a very easy number.

Supporting the prosecution of people\\'s words.\\n', u'\\nThanks for that. Fascinating and disturbing read.\\n', u'\\nIf you weren\\'t white maybe you wouldn\\'t be so quick to cry \"laughable hysteria\" when a self-confessed white supremacist starts pulling the governmental strings of the most powerful free nation on Earth.\\n', u\"\\nYou do realise this whataboutery is like saying that Hitler wasn't so bad because Kaiser Wilhelm invaded Belgium don't you?\\n\", u'\\nYeah but 7 are specifically targeted to appease his right wing base.\\n', u'\\n\"Terrorism is no more a muslim problem than it is a christian problem. And Islamophobia is rife.\"\\nAh yes, that tiresome canard... Keep plugging away with that fiction, and you just create more Trump voters...\\n', u\"\\nUnfortunately for the planet, Trump does listen to him. He has appointed Bannon as 'The Chief Counselor to the President of the United States'. It sounds so dignified, doesn't it? But the Nazi's did a similar stunt by wearing fancy black uniforms and knee-length shiny boots. A fascist is a fascist whatever title his mad boss gives him, or whatever footwear he favours.\\n\", u'\\nBannon...the most dangerous man in America...\\nYou really believe this? Ha ha ha\\n', u'\\nThis polls have a very questionable wording: \"terror prone countries\", or \"stop terrorists coming here\" which will give a horrendous bias in the results. \\nRepeat to yourself in the mirror: \"I must do more to educate myself in scientific thinking\".\\n', u'\\nWith Bannon running the show, Putin First is the order of the day. I fear that our country is truly being run by a Putin insider.\\n', u\"\\nThe US already has cheap energy, lots of it. At 0.12/0.13 $/KWH it's cheaper than anywhere in the EU, sometimes by a large margin; in Germany, for example, it's around 0.4 $/KWH and even in China it's only a few cents less than the US price.\\nTrump wants to build pipelines because he owns shares in the companies who build and run the pipelines, not because he gives a damn about the people of the USA. Almost all those hydrocarbons running through those pipelines are destined for export markets, thus enriching the share-holders and not the ordinary people of the USA.\\nSlash (regulations) 'n' burn (more fossil fuels)...the ethos of those who cannot see the forest for the trees...\\n\", u\"\\n\\nAre Trump and Bannon worse\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nand if so how?\\n\\nNeither W nor Rumsfeld were authoritarians. And most certainly not wannabe totalitarians. Bush also never brought Karl Rove into the NSC, for example, and then Rove most certainly is no Bannon either.\\nYou've never read the new Breitbart or followed anything Bannon ever has said, have you? As for Trump, have you missed the Muslim ban? Never happened under Bush and Rumsfeld.\\n\\nuntil someone even worse like Marine Le Pen grabs your attention\\n\\nMarine Le Pen is bad. Make no mistake. But - in all honesty - she's less dangerous to France and to the world around her than Trump and Bannon are over in the US.\\n(Of course, Marion Marechal-Le Pen and her nasty grandfather are exactly on the level with Trump and Bannon, but it's Marine who is running for President.)\\n\", u'\\nDelusions on this scale are probably treatable.\\n', u'\\nYes, something more specific that the alleged \"claptrap bullshit that . . . .\"\\n', u'\\n\"islam and terrorism are not the same\"I can only assume that either your English is very poor or your education level very low. I said nothing that anyone with an average intelligence would read as \"islam =terrorism.\" Quite the opposite. \\nI said that there is a nexus between islam and terrorism. Maybe go get help with the words, and then I will happily discuss with you.\\n', u\"\\nPresident GW Bush did not allow Karl Rove to attend NSC meetings. He did not want to risk politicizing decisions affecting the country's security.\\nThe restructuring of the NSC to permit Brannon's attendance, while excluding the Joint Chiefs, except for discussions of matters of military concern, illustrates the total incompetence of our new dear leader and the sinister spell the alt-right has over him.\\n\", u\"\\nDoubtful. You assume they play by the rules - in fact they relish re-writing the rules. There will be no impeachment; worse still there may in fact never be another 'free and fair' election.\\n\", u\"\\nBeen shared earlier, but if you want a quick read that explains exactly what's happened and why over the last couple of days do yourself a favour. ...............

It just has to resonate. I don't find it surprising that people who were previously forced to seek sanctuary would empathise with those who currently do.\\nI am not religious but I don't believe that any religion, Islam included, is wholly made up of unpleasant ideas. Careful you don't render yourself part of the problem.\\n\", u\"\\nThis guy's ideology is a holy war: judeo-christianity v islam\\nHe's a dangerous man..trump is obviously appeasing the alt right but he needs to be careful in giving bannon such power\\n\", u\"\\nI already referred you to the petition's own map which is much better than a simplified image on a known liars website.\\n\", u\"\\nHe's not the most dangerous man in America. That's just stupid.

One of the very few right wing people who are actually funny and often quite accurate.\\nI'm not so sure about Pence being any better than Trump though. I guess he is slightly less likely to cause a nuclear war between China and the US. Pence is still a far right religious lunatic though.\\n\", u\"\\nThat's OK then, we can ban all American religious people from the UK because many of them are as barking as the Islamic fundamentalists, if not more so.\\n\", u\"\\nThere's going to be a civil war I the US.

And Islamophobia is rife and in the mainstream - just read the Express. Telling people they are the problem if they point this out is dangerous and encourages its acceptance. \\nI agree that proper debate on serious issues is required, but hard to get (Bannon and those like him are talented at controlling the message, distorting fact to fit their narrative). However if the centre agree with this just because they want to get some air-time and credibility with the electorate all they are doing is re-enforcing Bannon's grip.\\n\", u'\\nHe worst men are like this though. They are desperate and confused and sad.\\n', u\"\\nMore silly twaddle about Hitler. I still don't see any Brownshirts.\\n\", u'\\nThe problem is the POTUS does\\n', u'\\nThat might be true of some people, but it is pompous to dismiss everyone who wants to have a discussion about it. Instead, we normally have to listen to the tiresome preamble (and, often, never get past the tiresome preamble...) about \"guarding against xenophobia\" and \"cultural enrichment\" and related droning first. \\nConsider the pensions shortfall. Let\\'s set aside the fact that it was Labour\\'s tax raid (Gordon Brown, making Robert Maxwell and Philip Green look like an amateurs) that did more than any other recent intervention to wreck pensions provisions. The idea that pensions can be solved by continuing to import ever more low-wage workers is a Ponzi-scheme that would be criminal in the private sector. \\nStrained NHS? Sure - in part because capacity planning for the NHS has not been linked to population growth, and NHS capacity-development takes longer to implement than the open-borders to Europe take to let cities-full of people in. And I don\\'t think you will find any grown-up who thinks there should not be a guest-worker program that would include opportunities for people to work in the NHS. \\nNo sensible person argues that \"most of the country\\'s problems are caused by foreigners.\" That\\'s just another discussion-avoidance tactic. And it is ceasing to be effective - as Trump\\'s election, and Brexit prove.\\n', u\"\\nand actually the fucking hilarious thing is Americans are killing themselves at the rate of 10,000 a year with their mental gun laws!

Steve Bannon controls the White House. Look at him. He's the president now. Run, liberals, run!\\n\", u'\\nWhat is it with the Guardian and Godwin?\\n', u'\\n\\nAre Trump and Bannon worse, and if so how?\\n\\nI\\'m surprised you have to ask that. Bannon has published articles like \"Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy\" and \"There\\'s no hiring bias against women in tech, they just suck at interviews\". Or how about \"Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew\" and \"The solution to online \\'harassment\\' is simple: Women should log off\".\\nTrump says when you\\'re a star you can just grab women by the pussy, they just let you. He said that most Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers, he said that women who have abortion should be punished.\\nIf Bush has said any of the things that Trump has said, or if Rumsfeld and Cheney had published articles the tenor of those published by Bannon then they would surely have been hounded out of government. Trump has been caught lying about many things, yet Clinton was almost impeached for lying about an affair.\\nSure, Trump and Bannon are bogeymen, but not in the same way.

This populist revolt has no nobility or righteous purpose but is just waves of hate and stupidity upon which horrors like Bannon are riding to power. \\nThis is what Golding envisioned in 'Lord of the Flies.'\\n\", u\"\\nYesterday, NY Times described Bannon as a 'right wing agitator'.

What the ban does is draw a new line of mainstream debate- 'should Muslims be banned from entering the US?' which a few months ago was a subject only fit for far right forums (even Trump had to row back after he suggested it). Bannon would like this to be the line which defines the new centre. \\nThis is why protest is so important- it demonstrates that this is not a normal issue about which regular people disagree, but a an outrageous proposal which is beyond the pale for a liberal democracy.\\nAnd let's hope it continues, because unless Trump grows tired of Bannon then I imagine a Muslim registry will be his next goal, perhaps after the immigration ban expires or is struck down.\\n\", u\"\\nYou'll see comments here from the likes of someone called Freidenkerr that attempts to normalise and tamp down the involvement and engagement of someone like Bannon at the very root of US government. Steps are required to consistently call out and resist any normalisation before outrageous policies become described as progressive and aligned with strategy. We're at the very lip of the precipice here, and Trump and co are trying to present it otherwise. \\nThose steps include a demand that Britain takes a leadership role in calling out and influencing US policy. May needs to turn her attention to creating a stronger coalition with the likes of Merkel, as tricky as that would be, rather than Trump and his gang of crazies. Wake up Britain.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nIt does look like we are seeing the left completely drop any pretense of caring about poor, non-urban people.\\n\\nIf those poor non-urban people are fascists then nope I don't care about them, I don't care about fascists because they sure as hell don't care about me. They'd see me dead. This is a fight. The sooner the liberal urban dwellers realise this the better. A fight we liberals can't win by trying to care or understand the fascists.\\n\", u\"\\nI think Trump's far from being a fool. He's the one who using Bannon and not the other way around. He uses all the Bannons he can get a hold of to create that scorch earth atmostphere to instill fear and own the room. He then moves in for the kill. He tried and failed with Clinton, Obama,...He succeeded with his 16 opponents during the Republican primaries. He won;t make it with a Merkel or a Xi Xianping. \\nThat's Trump's MO and it's so predictable. Scare the hell out of the guy, then move in on him.\\n\", u\"\\nSeriously? He didn't say what the article said he said.\\n\", u\"\\nI think it is more than that. How sincere is Trump? Not at all, he is insincere. I think he wants to make America 'whiter'. His policies, including the travel ban, are protectionist and I think these companies recognise it as not just about keeping America safe. Not with so many terrorist attacks being home grown.

Islam, on the other hand, is a set of ideas, not a race; and a rather unpleasant set of ideas at that.\\nAs for Bannon, I didn't have to delve far into his past to find out that he is indeed a very dangerous person.

At the end of those times everybody felt free to kill anyone over religious differences. USA made it's constitution, giving right to kill anyone regardless of religious beliefs. Of course, I joked about the Wild West. So, it gave freedom at the time. But times are changing. All around the world, the power of religious leaders dropped. Democracy was introduced and business. Today religions walking smilingly, hand in hand under the rainbow. There are different ways but one goal. There are over a dozen countries, who refuses to come out of middle ages. Still religious people rule in all areas in life. Shias killing Sunnies anytime, except when it goes other way around. Who doesn't share their belief is a dog. Exepted those, who are pigs. Killing them always pleases the Big Boss. There are countries, where they take the light version. In Malaysia, I was told, Muslims would visit and celebrate Christmas with their Christian friends. Today there is no call for the American Constitution. It has to be changed to serve freedom. Those countries should be absolutely banned, which cannot bring under a certain level of the right wing religions and their rule in society. For those people entering to other countries carrying the same problems there. They grow in number in a incredible speed, will undermine the host country. Finally dumping it to civil war. Freedom today means, that in those countries were human rights are respected, there is tolerance and respect, they have the right to reject those, who will not change in a million years for nothing.

It does not just undermine the moral claim the US might have to represent the free world, it gives a free pass to dictators who want to punish their own citizens by making them stateless knowing the US will not come to their aid, ever. A shameful position for Trump to take, but one that may not last.\\n\", u'\\nNever really wanted to visit the US anyway...Funnily enough that view has not changed for the better recently.Got enough on our plate over here with our home grown fash.\\n', u\"\\nOne of the tactics embraced by Lenin was to join with the Social Democrats, a stronger majority party, to achieve power. Once you have power then you can dispense with the non-revolutionaries.\\nThis tactic wasn't unique to Lenin, its been used successfully countless times over history including by the Nazis. Although comparing anything to the Nazis is a time worn cliche its worth studying their organization, philosophies and methods rather than focusing on the usual Teutonic photogenic stuff because that doesn't get old -- Nazis and their like are like an opportunistic virus, they're always with us waiting for their chance to reshape us in their image of glory.\\n\", u'\\nIf you had read the Executive Order, you would know that the minority of Muslim countries that have been suspended do not comply with US data requirements and screening procedures. Saudi Arabia does comply with US data requirements.\\n', u\"\\nIt's what's behind the ruling that's the issue. If the president is truly interested in cracking down on illegal immigration and terrorists, why isn't Saudi Arabia on the list of targeted countries?\\n\", u\"\\nYou're not allowed to use it anymore, cos it makes the fascists cry and run back to their basements.\\n\", u'\\n\"How many of the people\" - the exact same question was asked of Kellyann Conway.\\nShe deflected and tried to divert the subject - it turned out that the Trump admin doesn\\'t a clue, \"How many\".\\n-------------------\\n', u'\\nSo your ok with 5 year old boys being handcuffed for 5 hours in US airports because they could be a \"terrorism threat\"?\\n', u'\\nGo ahead, Curt. \\nExpand.\\n', u'\\nCare to make a critique of Bush 1&2 or only Obama?Care to comment on the actions of the current encumbent or only on Obama?\\n', u'\\nThe democrats are so lost.\\n', u'\\nYou need to pay attention. The WH encouraged Customs and Border staff who were refusing people entry even though there was a stay on the ban. Now Trump has fired an AG who said the ban was in her view unconstitutional and shouldn\\'t be enforced until its legality could be determined in a courtroom, using language like \"betrayed\" that no President has used before in announcing an official would be leaving their post. It is clear that he views the entire state apparatus as tools of his will and doesn\\'t understand that the judiciary is not subservient to the executive but equal to it. I would say you\\'re the one who doesn\\'t understand the US system of checks and balances. You are probably unfamiliar with Watergate, but Nixon\\'s attempt to overrule and fire an AG for political purposes was one of the major factors that led to his impeachment. Checks and balances functioned in those days. Now, not so much.\\n', u'\\nWhat he said he would do was odious, so yes he has made good on that.His voters should be glad, and hopefully white and non-Muslim, otherwise they are screwed.\\n', u\"\\nBut Trump is doing all the things he said he would on the campaign trail and Republicans voted for him. Establishment figures such as Paul Ryan completely misjudged the mood of the disenfranchised Republican base, he has no choice but to follow Trump's lead. Since late 2015, he's been the most senior Republican but now that's not the case. As much as he'd like to tell Trump to go fuck himself, much like Theresa May, Trump is the President and Ryan has to work with him. The rest of the world is just keeping its head down and hoping Trump is a one term President. Unfortunately for us, the smug prick will never let us forget he made it to the White House.\\n\", u\"\\nYou do know that Bannon is a former Goldman Sachs man don't you?\\n\", u'\\nthanks to Mrs Mayhem more like it\\n', u'\\nAmazon, Microsoft, Google are simply preserving their image and playing to their customer base.\\n', u\"\\nsocial media's actually social utility is poor but pretty handy to keep tabs on people's views and opinions.

An elected President imposes time-limited travel ban onto some few thousand persons and very few individuals had to \"suffer\" some short detainment at airports. That\\'s unsavoury, but hardly a reason to instigate civil unrest, esoecially since the judicative is looking into it and able and powerful enough to stop aspects of this action in case they are unlawful.I\\'ve seen much worse acts commited by the US authorities and agencies over the recent dears. Extrajudicial killings of innocents, illegal mass-surveillance, rendition flights, torture, Guantanamo, creating or supporting terrorgroups and coups against elected governments, paying honour to a deceased Saudi-King and on and in the list goes. Outrage? Few and far between, hardly from urban latte-sippers.I hope the US Authorities are reacting as decisive against any unlawful form of \"protest\" als they\\'ve shown violence throughout the years and world. Take a sip of your own medicine, complacent, self-absorbed, ignorant, so called liberals\\n', u\"\\nI hear what you are saying, this is the problem politically today, but sadly Trump et al are not the answer to a prayer that some of his voters thought he would be. I mean sure he shook up the status quo, but for the worse not the better.It is not a 'peoples' revolution, it is the reign of a far right white supremacist, so only 'certain' people will be served by this President.\\n\", u\"\\nBut Bannon, in contrast to the president, is not easily distracted. He is intelligent, articulate, focused in his ideology and dedicated to the struggle. And he has now been catapulted by an undisciplined president to the inner precincts of the National Security Council and its principals\\u2019 committee, assuming a position senior to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence.\\nUnvetted, unconfirmed but immensely powerful, Bannon may just be the most dangerous man in America.\\nI think we have to be realistic and recognise that the USA is probably closer to a coup than at any time since the 1930s. This really is a constitutional crisis for America imo. Whether it is Trump or Bannon or others who are the driving force behind the former's first insane week as POTUS is irrelevant, what matters is what is happening. In a functioning, healthy democracy, and democratic system, these odious people, such as Trump and Bannon, would get nowhere near the offices of major power.\\n\", u'\\nKim Jong Trump\\n', u'\\nThought there was a light at the end of the tunnel, turned out someone had just left a burning cross.\\n', u'\\nInteresting, if irrelevant, insight into your voyeuristic tendencies.\\n', u'\\nAnd thanks to Brexit, he is now our new best friend\\n', u'\\nDivide that by a million.\\n', u\"\\nCertainly Bannon wants national unity.

The un-elected leader of Trump's Deep State.\\n\", u'\\nOh please, you already are doing exactly that, and have been for many years.\\n', u\"\\nAre you British? 'Tool' is an insult in US English.\\n\", u\"\\nBut is he doing that? Trump's approach to just issue and Executive Order that has not been subject to legal advice, is often issues without consultation with the department that must implement the policy, and without the scrutiny of either Congress or the Supreme Court is in fact just a powerful memo that can be rescinded or declared illegal, but yet it looks and sounds good on TV and maybe that it all that matters. So far, Trump has achieved nothing, but has sown division and discord in his own country and been exposed as incompetent.\\n\", u\"\\nExcept that per capita purchasing power is up $2,400 from when he took office while unemployment is back below the levels it was before the recession. Workforce participation is indeed down about 3-3.5% from pre recession levels, but up to 50% of that decrease is due to the aging population. Tens of millions more people have health insurance while things like eliminating preexisting condition denial of coverage and staying on your parent's insurance longer have helped many get insured who wouldn't have had sufficient coverage before.\\nIt was a slow and uneven recovery, but it was a recovery no matter which way you look at it. The most unfortunate piece is that it largely was on the backs of the middle class rather than the top 10%, but I don't know how much of that you can actually pin on Obama, whose already moderate policies were pushed even further to the right (read: protecting big business and the ultra wealthy) by an obstructionist legislative branch.\\nI'm really sick of people completely underselling his legacy. It is mixed for sure (significantly reducing troop levels but continuing military engagement), passing many vital consumer protection bills (but not doing enough to take on wall street), etc but the people who act like he did nothing for 8 years just don't remember the depths of the state of affairs from 06-09. The country took an absolute swan dive in almost every manner and has made a significant amount of recovery.\\n\", u'\\nI think you are right.\\n', u'\\nYup. Already happening.\\n', u'\\nCongratulations.

Look at the excellent Brookings article. We can argue about Bannon\\'s prescription; we\\'re fools if we dismiss the concern about the future of civilized, open and liberal societies. Wilders, in the Netherlands, for example, is gaining in popularity because of the attacks on liberal democracy from within the Netherlands. The idea that a politician would be prosecuted simply for suggesting immigration is too high is truly terrifying. \\nThe West has completely ignored several important issues for years: (i.) the islam/terrorism nexus, (ii.) the effects of globalization and the options for managing its harsher effects, (iii.) the impact of ill-managed immigration and (iv.) the impact of (foisted) multiculturalism. Grown up discussion on these topics has usually been dismissed or shut down, and as a result marginalized. \\nBut people are not stupid. They know there is a nexus between islam and terrorism, even if its nuances are not clear (and if you respond with \"but not all muslims are terrorists,\" or use that idiot-word \"islamophobia,\" you are part of the problem). So when eventually politicians come along and offer to finally do something, the lies people have been told are remembered - and vote for a more radical response. And you get Trump. \\nIn the UK, by analogy, Dianne Abbott is the worst enemy of a humane and rational immigration policy - her ghastly bloviations every time the topic of managed immigration comes up are the best possible thing for the close-the-borders brigade. \\nWe need a radical new perspective and new set of policies if Bannon\\'s position is not to be the prevailing one.\\n', u'\\nLooking at that face, I would say Banny Breitfart likes a drink or two...\\n', u\"\\nIf you don't want to be held responsible for what you say, don't say it.\\n\", u'\\n\\nBannon a unknown,unvetted and unelected person in the White House pulling the strings and making the GOP dance to a tune they cannot hear\\n\\nWait until Trumps gets to see this cartoon. \\nhttps://twitter.com/PiaGuerra/status/825894457396514816/photo/1\\n', u'\\nI really look forward to Today each morning to see how Trump has further damaged his failing presidency.\\n', u'\\nare you saying the Press Association is a right-wing blogger?\\nHave you looked at the map on the governments website?\\nhttp://petitionmap.unboxedconsulting.com/?petition=171928\\nBoth maps are based on constituencies, so take account of population density etc. (to a certain extent, obviously, Labour buggered everything up for their electoral advantage but what can you do?)The red and purple bits are where the vote is concentrated and that corresponds very closely to the Press Association article\\nhttps://order-order.com/2017/01/30/londoners-behind-trump-petition-rest-country-not-fussed/\\n', u\"\\nIf what you are saying is true, why hasn't Saudi Arabia been targeted?What nationality was Osama bin Laden, whose organisation perpetrated the biggest act of terrorism on US soil?\\n\", u'\\nMaybe all Bannon has to do is feed Trump a daily conveyor belt of something to grab.... and get on with the scheming while his so-called \"boss\" is playing away.\\n', u'\\nBecause Trump and Bannon have a better grasp of the issues than tired old know-nothing Generals.

Many modern politicians are not conviction politicians with a long ideological course. Modern politics is so dependent on presentation and PR that true ideologues and conviction politicians rarely make it to the top.

Instead there is naivety mixed with crude bullying. The real fear is not whether he fulfils his campaign promises or betrays them.

There are so many in every old part of town, people taken away and killed for nothing, because someone said they were \"Jews, not Germans\", and the neighbours didn\\'t speak up because it was dangerous or because they were fine with it. After the war, many people in Germany were in complete denial, even though so many neighbours went missing without a trace and so many people were party of the killing machine. So this is where it ends if you get on that slippery slope of declaring a whole group of people \"dangerous\".

Iran\\u2019s government has also vowed to take \"reciprocal measures\" to ban U.S. citizens.\\n\\n', u\"\\nYes, it's very important to understand that Donald Trump is just Bannon's hand puppet.\\nRepublicans like Ryan, McConnell and Cruz imagine that they're going to be able to shove Bannon aside and get their own hands up the puppet -- but my guess is they're in for a major surprise. \\nAnd Prime Minister May is going to discover that she's been kissing the wrong guy's ring -- but probably too late.\\n\", u'\\nAs if you did, or do.\\n', u'\\nRead Goethe: \"The spirits that I summoned up. I now can\\'t rid myself.\" Bannon will be devoured by his own revolution.\\n', u'\\nPence and Bannon - handlers-in-chief.\\nScarier than Rove and Cheney?\\n', u\"\\nThe whole situation reminds me of Dick Chaney and Bush, imo. But you know what, I fell no fear. I feel it is time for the US to pay the bills. Chaney and Rumsfeld and the rest of them were never prosecuted. Now we got the second round of the same. I don't know why this is surprising to anyone.\\nAnd if you think Hillary was going to be a solution to this, you are very much mistaken. She was going to embark on further foreign destabilization and it all would've come crushing down around our ears, just in a different way.\\n\", u\"\\nNot when he is staring blankly at the Executive Order while a Bannon mini-me jabs at the page, instructing the Orange Overlord where to sign his name. Trump is thick, and probably lazy to boot. Having a pop at Meryl Streep on Twitter doesn't count as work in the grand scheme of things.\\n\", u'\\nWork- and alcoholic from his appearance and reputation. Not a stable personality. All bile and compensation-seeking behaviour.\\n', u\"\\nHow would you describe being detained and then forced to sign away your residency rights in a legal document you couldn't understand (backed up by lies told to you by the officials holding you) before being sent off to to another country where you life is at risk?\\n\", u'\\nWas there a purpose to your comment?\\n', u'\\napols for the typos!\\n', u'\\nHe just sacked one of the checks and balances\\n', u\"\\nYeah Trumps victory showed personal attacks don't work.\\nOh, wait...\\n\", u'\\nWe may have to consider the possibility that she does not want to.\\n', u\"\\nDon't know about that connection (quite possible though) but at least the circus going on in US is an excellent diversion. I think the world should keep an eye on the East, too, these times.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump is Disaster Capitalism's T-Rex: small hands and small brain but great big teeth.\\n\", u'\\nAnd for me Trump has a creepy whiff of the J Sav***es.\\n', u'\\n\"Rich people make their money by exploiting chaos, which they often caused themselves\"\\nBless. Of course, that\\'s why you\\'re poor. Its all Someone Else\\'s Fault.\\n', u\"\\nIf war comforts you, I'm confident you will soon have your wish, at the rate things are going.\\n\", u'\\nHopefully it is not too late to get Rush Limpboil on the NSC. He and Steve can tell war stories from their days in the Marines.....wait....\\n', u'\\nWell, he seems to sign his name a lot and send out tweets. Does that count?\\n', u\"\\nYou wouldn't see people being whipped into a frenzy on the Daily Mail site, would you?\\n\", u'\\nCould even say the same about the UK - look at all those Tory shires. The difference is that a lot of the folk there are stinking rich.\\n', u'\\nBannon and Trump. The best recruiters that Isis has ever had.\\n', u'\\n\"There is no reason to doubt Trump right now.\"\\nYep. That\\'s the only correct thing in your comment. There\\'s no reason at all to doubt that he\\'s a cross between a crook and a dangerously unhinged narcissistic sociopath with strong authoritarian traits.\\n11 days gone. Only 1449 to go, if we all manage to get that far.\\n', u\"\\nAnd The Mother of Parliaments is about to roll over and hand over our country's future. Nobody voted for this.\\n\", u'\\n\\nBoth are workaholics\\n\\nReally? Trump is that industrious?\\n', u'\\nWill Bannon take down Trump the way Cheney took down Bush?\\n', u'\\nPerhaps you missed it. The USA voted. The system they have elected Trump. Odd that in a year or two the world could change again; mid term elections. And then again in another two years. There\\'s also the concept that he might get impeached (No one really seems to like him, and I am sure there are people warming up the bonfire to cook him). But no, it\\'s all get angry, deny etc.\\nTrump got there because... \"First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.\" \\nThere\\'s also the, Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance sequence to consider.\\nDear God, lighten up, and live your lives people. Stop with the whining, do something.\\n', u\"\\nIt's only a matter of time before they test out the reaction to bringing in the military to prevent opposition. Just look at his face, he is gagging to start shooting people on the streets.\\n\", u'\\nNot sure the description of Steve Bannon presented by Guardian is accurate. But the system that led to the crisis of 2008 and the wars in Middle East and Ukraine has to be destroyed indeed. This is a correct attitude.\\n', u\"\\nWhat about the 'idiots' in Westminster as we speak? They are voting for Trump's and Bannon's version of capitalism, via Brexit. Trump already has a siege mentality, and Theresa May is looking the other way while he grabs her *****.\\n\", u\"\\nhe will do what it takes to make sure that the people of this country are winning. He wants America to be great and fior its people to prosper. That's a good thing for all of us.\\n\", u'\\nIran made a missile launching this week defying the agreement achieved withthe Western Super-Powers.So let me tell you that I was much more terrified when the duo Obama and Kerry called the shots in the White House.Even if Bannon tries very very hard, he cannot cause the same damage as the Democrat duo.\\n', u\"\\nI envisage Donald Trump and find impossible envisioning him as the President of the United States.\\nI envisage U.S. presidents, kind of like looking at Mount Rushmore, and can envision Trump.\\nWhat comes to mind when I can't avoid thinking about Trump and his hacks Bannon, Conway and Spicer is a silent film era comedy with fools running around making funny faces and subtitles with outrageous comments that would embarrass the Three Stooges.\\nAn American tradition older than the country is disagreeing with presidents and politicians, criticizing them, even making fun of them like TV shows in the 70s did and late night show hosts do. However, neither I nor any American since April 30th 1789 has been embarrassed by a president or insulted by a president or lied to so blatantly and disrespectfully by a president.\\nPresidents have lied, yes. None has treated Americans like fools by telling lies that are so obviously lies and berating us for not accepting them as truth. November 3, 2020 can't come soon enough!\\n\", u'\\nTrump has already filed the forms to run in 2020. Of course, think of all the money he can now legally collect from his group of billionaires. Can you say cash cow?\\n', u'\\nWell BG, that is the only confirmed and sure way of fighting fascism!\\n', u\"\\n'84 is here again ... the future's looking bleak again ...\\nThe various adaptations of Orwell's 1984 don't appear to answer the question of why the state has instituted the tyrannical regime that dominates the book. Perhaps we could look to our current situation in America for answers.\\nWe all (should) know that in the book, the Inner Party runs an Oceania in a perpetual state of unwinnable war; that all citizens are constantly monitored; that thinking, in and of itself, is a crime; and all are lorded over by a charismatic figure, whose role is claimed to be benevolent.\\nThe movie Zeitgeist (2007) explores several themes, but centrally, that peaceful times throttle the ability of the moneyed elite to make money. Thus, they theorize that the war on terror was initiated simply to open up the floodgates of wealth. Some may find the arguments against religion, and for the Bush administration's complicity in 9/11, a little far-fetched, but they are at the very least thought provoking.\\nThe apparatus for monitoring the populace is now in Trump's hands; he has revived the war on education with his cabinet appointments; he is seeking to control our thoughts, beginning with trying to diminish the role of the 'mainstream' media; and he seems hell-bent on escalating the war on terror by poking the hornet's nest in as many ways as possible. If Trump truly wanted to protect Americans, then eliminating guns, reversing climate change, and proliferating healthcare would all seem like laudable directions to take ... but that wouldn't make the wealthiest wealthier!\\nPerhaps we need a slim young thing with a sledgehammer!\\n... let us all Resist our fears again ... happy days will come again!\\n\", u'\\n\\nhe said he would America a winner, like he is a winner, so we have to trust him.\\n\\nStraightforward question - do you think Trump would hesitate to ignore the Constitution if it suited him? Honest answers please.\\n', u'\\nBut not from Saudi Arabia where nearly all of the 9/11 terrorists hailed from...\\n', u'\\nSounds like a paranoid nutjob. I can see why he and his supreme leader get along.\\n', u'\\nsame in Turkey..the simple rural idiots put Erdogan in power..their stupidity outnumbers the intellectuals\\n', u\"\\nthanks for that. I love how he completely neglects the recent fact, that is was the US (and UK) who created conditions for ISIS in the first place with an illegal invasion, driving the secularist ex Saddam officer core into an organised force to fight an occupying American army. Zarqawi was just an unemployed jihadi fantasist until Iraq gave him a cause to to his fight to. The round of of fighters into the prisons created the learning ground for what would become ISIS. Americans have poured petrol in the fire since the first Gulf War, ironically to aid the despicable Saudi's and protect their oil.The fact the chickens have come home to roost should surprise no-one with a brain. Unfortunately though that subscribe to Bannon's world view don't have one.Lastly you can thank that prick Murdoch and Fox for creating the right conditions on the media for Trump to be possible.Un-fucking-believable.Bannon is insane and needs to be stopped.\\n\", u'\\nAbsolutely spot on. The man is a fascist. Conventional politics are out of the window.\\n', u\"\\nJust think the might of the US military machine and industrial complex in the hands of fascists. Inconceivable? So was a Trump Presidency till a few months ago... The US is a militaristic empire evolved over the last several decades with an internal apparatus designed for the suppression and control of populations. Military and police are disconnected(from the social fabric), indoctrinated professionals who will serve anyone with even a thin veil of legitimacy. Especially one pandering to their militaristic values. A fascist's wet dream, really. It just needs that little nudge to tip over.Just think what Trump casually said just a few days ago that the US should have taken the Iraqi oil and that he is still looking into options there. Interesting times ahead...but hey, what about Russia, right?\\n\", u'\\nThere might be an easier way to get rid of him: if he has this much power as seems, the media could turn their attention to him and ignore Trump. I believe Trump would not like being publicly sidelined.\\n', u'\\nhow did that end? happy ending?\\n', u'\\nYou sure know a lot about a person you never met.\\n', u'\\nThe GOP have hitched themselves to the Trump wagon. Most will jump off before they get to the cliff, but not before they radically change the country.\\n', u\"\\n\\nBannon is an altogether different creature. Listen to his early speeches. Bannon is a crusader, fighting to redeem a corrupt country betrayed by its feckless and greedy leaders. He once described himself as a \\u201cLeninist\\u201d, intent on destroying \\u201call of today\\u2019s establishment\\u201d.\\n\\nNot sure whether he's so concerned about neoliberalism or New Deal economics, but I'd assume from the above that he wants to win the culture war once and for all for the conservative side? It's become a serious business...\\n\", u'\\nWhile Cheney is odious he is nothing on Bannon ...\\n', u'\\n\\nEducational system in Oz really is as bad as we hear then?\\nDid the text \"we have all the wealth and knowledge, I don\\'t see why we should be shackled with racist losers like Trump and Bannon\" really not give you the teensiest clue that he is not in Oz? Nor Kansas :)\\n', u\"\\nSpicer is Trump's Anus.\\n\", u\"\\nTrumps giddy, fainting trumpy-bopper fans are ecstatic. Would could be better than a radical re-alignment away from multi-culturalism, equality and truth. Meanwhile, they'll be waiting for the rest of their lives for jobs that will not come. Coal isn't coming back. Foxcomm isn't going to build an assembly plant here, and even if they did, no one would take a $3/hour job. Nope. It's all jingoism, fear and hate all the time, while Trump enriches himself.\\n\", u\"\\nYou don't often see Vladimir Putin smile....but I bet he is smiling now.....\\n\", u\"\\nDon't complain to us, take it up with Trump. The little drama queen can't go ten minutes without being the center of attention,\\n\", u\"\\nAnd that's just Bannon!\\n\", u\"\\nAs we now know, the drafting and rollout of the travel ban was largely the work of Steve Bannon, the president\\u2019s chief political strategist. It was Bannon who reportedly overruled the proposal to exempt green card holders from the ban. And it was Bannon who pushed the order through without consulting experts at the Department of Homeland security or at the State Department.\\nIt's disturbing to hear people, who should know better, trying to argue that 'Obama did this first', or anything resembling it. Even bl@@dy Rees-Mog on C4 last night, what an idiot.\\n\", u'\\nThe picture above the article is very flattering. If you look at one in better focus you\\'ll see that Bannon has the dried, red face of a heavy drinker. If you hear his speeches written for Donald, you can tell he may be a \"workaholic\" - meaning he rants all day long- but he\\'s also paranoid, a bully and a liar, basically a classic clubby blow-hard, more concerned with being right than knowing the truth. He\\'s been to court for spousal abuse and without exception ex-partners in business are disgusted by him. Not in Putin\\'s league in terms of dangerous. Or Tillerson\\'s or Session\\'s.\\n', u'\\nSad that people are not willing to give the US system of government a chance. It was set up to so that the three branchs of the Federal government played things out against each other. And then there are the states. They have influence too.\\nBut no, all we get (particularly from the G) is \"Oh no, the world is ending! Catastrophe! We must kill/impeach/crush/destroy all those who disagree with us!\" Not a word (and if there is, it\\'s being spoken bloody quietly) about how the USI system works. The process. What must happen, the checks and balances.\\nThis is more depressing than having an arse in the White House.\\n', u\"\\nYes, he is very dangerous and I don't think people can quite grasp just what it is this guy represents and wants. The fact that anyone would associate with him outside of the peculiar world of internet conspiracy culture is odd enough, that he has made a stellar rise to the very heart of world power is almost beyond comprehension.\\n\\nTrump is a \\u201cblunt instrument for us,\\u201d Bannon told Ken Stern for Vanity Fair last summer. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know whether he really gets it or not.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom\\nVanity Fair\\n\", u\"\\nAgreed, just as in the 60's. It's gonna happen.\\n\", u'\\nif you want everything that the USA has to offer, then perhaps you should accept the responsibilities that go with citizenship.\\nI agree when is Trump going to show some responsibility?\\n', u\"\\nThat's a very fair point.\\n\", u'\\nI predict the return of the militant left.\\nThere will be no other way to combat creeping fascism.\\n', u'\\nTension is high in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between government troops and Russia-backed separatists has flared over the past three days.\\nThe sides traded blame on January 31 for a surge in hostilities around the government-controlled town of Avdiyivka that has led to the highest casualty toll since mid-December.\\nFunny how that started only a few hours after the phone call too Putin. Is the White House merely an annex of the Kremlin.\\n', u'\\nSome solid, post-factual reporting from The Onion: White House Staff Reminded To Place Lids Firmly On Trash Cans After Steve Bannon Gets Into Garbage Again \\nhttp://www.theonion.com/article/white-house-staff-reminded-place-lids-firmly-trash-55168\\n', u'\\nIdeology of the greedy. Great. Good luck.\\n', u'\\n\"Some of the upheaval appears to be the consequence of incompetence, the predictable result of an under-qualified real estate mogul struggling to master the most powerful and demanding job on the planet.\"\\nNaah.\\nTry again.\\nHe told you and the voters in June he would Build A Wall (TM). \\nHe told you and the voters in June that he would put a temporary ban on Muslims.\\nHe told you and the voters in June that he would cancel TTIP.\\nHe told you and the voters that he would seek a new way with Russia if possible.\\nWhat did you do in response to this ?\\nMake silly echo chamber jokes about SNL, his tan and how small his hands are.\\nSure, no problem.\\nNow look at you.\\nBesides, you know how America works. He couldn\\'t do the things he has done without the backing of the Deep State.\\nAnd the \"Muslim ban\" is not even a true ban of all when you consider Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, to name just two, are not on the list.\\nYou not liking those things, which is what the moaning and whining is really about, is irrelevant. ....as you\\'re finding out.\\nAt least you stopped blaming Putin.....for now.\\nGood luck.\\n', u\"\\nTrump's victory and Brexit proved that this shrill centred on personal attack just does not cut it. It is quite simple. There are complicated problems that the liberal-left have failed to address. Those wanting solutions have turned right. The left's response: name-calling, prescribing more of the same, screaming for protest (when polls in the US are showing over 50% support for the ban) , and the old tactics of shaming people (who no longer respect you) - are not working.\\n\", u'\\nBannon is Hitlers Anus\\n', u\"\\nif it continues to its natural conclusion, a few lives too\\nterrifying shit show, I wouldn't mind, but these are lessons we should have fucking learnt by now\\n\", u'\\nRich people make their money by exploiting chaos, which they often caused themselves.\\n', u\"\\nNo thanks. Let's fight his racism, misogyny and lies at every possible opportunity.\\n\", u'\\nI was rather amused by a Green Party leaflet pushed through the letterbox, stating, \"We will do everything we can to show refugees that they are welcome\". Presumably the same, \"we\" as are comparing a short term ban on entry from some unstable countries to mass extermination.\\n', u\"\\nNotwithstanding the travel ban's dubious legality, it is clearly in direct contravention of the 1st, 4th, 9th & 14th Amendments to the US Constitution.\\nThe lunatics are now running the asylum...\\n\", u'\\nWhen the government is taking multiple steps straight out of the fascist playbook and when genuine white supremacists are taking control then such comparisons are both pertinent and necessary.\\n', u\"\\nPresident Bannon it is....and it may be that Trumps ego won't be able to tolerate it indefinitely. \\nThe greatest weakness of Trump is how thin skinned he is. He can't bear even perceived minor slights and his paranoia will only grow. Look at his comically childish reactions to SNL, and the hilarious knots poor old Spicer had to tie himself in over those 'record breaking' inauguration crowds. \\nBannon will come unstuck sooner or later , thank god. Until then -at least - it's going to be a horrible time to be a decent American.\\n\", u\"\\nSo we've got the Nazi allusions, hyperbolic paranoia, and unhinged predictions.Checks all the boxes - send it to print!\\n\", u'\\nWhere there is a trump shit is bound to follow.\\n', u'\\nIndeed. People seem to be working themselves up into a frenzy, helped along by rags like the Guardian.\\n', u\"\\nIf you're going to troll at least make an effort.\\n\", u'\\n\"I can\\'t think why.\"\\nProbably because you\\'re wrong.\\n']\n",

didn\\u2019t take long. From no-drama Obama to all-trauma Trump: the shift has been seismic, leaving millions in this country and abroad frightened and struggling to make sense of America\\u2019s new political landscape.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Some of the upheaval appears to be the consequence of incompetence, the predictable result of an under-qualified real estate mogul struggling to master the most powerful and demanding job on the planet. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But not so with the travel ban. In this case, upheaval was the intent \\u2013 not to the degree we have seen; that clearly caught the administration off guard. But it was upheaval nonetheless. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>As we now know, the drafting and rollout of the travel ban was largely the work of Steve Bannon, the president\\u2019s chief political strategist. It was Bannon who reportedly <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html?_r=0\">overruled</a> the proposal to exempt green card holders from the ban. And it was Bannon who pushed the order through without consulting experts at the Department of Homeland Security or at the state department.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>The <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacht_und_Nebel\">Nacht und Nebel </a>quality of the ban\\u2019s announcement makes clear that the president\\u2019s chief strategist wanted to send tremors through the world. Here was bold proof that the portentous accents of Trump\\u2019s inaugural address, also Bannon\\u2019s work, was not mere rhetoric. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Now the world would know what \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d means \\u2013 not first in democracy or human rights; not first in recognizing an obligation to victims of humanitarian crisis (some of which we have helped create). No, this was America first in pugilism, parochialism and misplaced protectionism.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Some insist that all this is simply Bannon throwing meat to the president\\u2019s base, plucking a page from Karl Rove\\u2019s playbook. Rove, the chief strategist for George W Bush (for whom many are now feeling a once inconceivable nostalgia), famously sought to consolidate his boss\\u2019s power not by tacking toward the middle but by feeding the base.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Only it would be wrong to see Bannon as Rove 2.0. At his heart, Rove was a consummate political operator, for whom ideology was a tool, not an article of belief. Rove was a careerist and an opportunist, whose principal goal was the preservation and expansion of Republican political power.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>Bannon is an altogether different creature. Listen to his early speeches. Bannon is a crusader, fighting to redeem a corrupt country betrayed by its feckless and greedy leaders. He once described himself as a \\u201cLeninist\\u201d, intent on destroying \\u201call of today\\u2019s establishment\\u201d.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>For Bannon, America is engaged in a pitched struggle against threats from within and without. It is a battle that will last years, and requires iron resolve and steely determination. If the free press, a bastion of democratic self-governance, does not grasp these elusive truths, then it should \\u201ckeep its mouth shut\\u201d, he says.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Bannon is not the president\\u2019s servant. The president is his tool. For years, Bannon cast about for the proper vehicle to carry the fight forward. Sarah Palin, Rick Perry \\u2013they were considered possible material. Now in Donald Trump he has found adequate if imperfect stuff. Both are workaholics. Both share a protectionist mindset. Both are combative.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But Bannon, in contrast to the president, is not easily distracted. He is intelligent, articulate, focused in his ideology and dedicated to the struggle. And he has now been <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/lobbying-ban-trump-executive-order-isis-strategy\">catapulted</a> by

(Or ten or twenty. Depending how many parents you and your partner have.)Downsize or pay bedroom tax, but then magic up suitable accommodation. \\nChildless people, magic up some children, because the tax you paid all those years for an old age pension was pissed away by government: and the private pension you had missold to you is wirthless and the next pension you started was destroyed in the Crash, all courtesy of Tory policy.\\n', u'\\nI imagine that my dad would be better off and live longer without my \"caring\" skills and that the last thing he\\'d want is me trying to \"look after him\".\\n', u'\\nThe Tories can afford private granny care.

You say for a while when some people end up needing care for years or decades. Personally I've seen one of the hardest things for family carers is to give up responsibility when they go into care and not to feel guilt about it. I refuse to believe they are mostly just not trying hard enough to make sacrifices.\\n\", u'\\nNone of them solved, or even seriously addressed, the elderly care issue.\\n', u\"\\nChildren start school at 5 years old, so even without outside help parents can go to work.Elderly people are infirm for much longer than 5 years and there is nowhere free you can bring them to be looked after while you work.Two of my grandparents went through dementia. If you've ever looked after someone in that state you'll know it's no small task. At least while children are in the trying to get themselves killed and soiling themselves phase they aren't large enough to fight you.\\n\", u'\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of families to look after each other, throughout the generations, with the State assisting if necessary. Primarily the families, with the State as secondary, arguably a safety net.\\n\\nI do not think i can agree with this for many reasons.\\nOne small example for you.\\nlook at the way our society has been going over the last 40 years. Gone are the days where one adult could afford to stay at home and look after the kids or elderly relatives while the bread winner went out to work.\\nWhen the state is in perpetual austerity and is continually cutting back on public services and a family needs both adults to be in work in order to ensure the bills are paid then it should really be abundantly clear that society can no longer work in the kinds of ways it was in days gone by.\\n', u\"\\nYou mean you're still going on about Labour. Jesus.\\nActually Labour did some good things in social care. It is the new age of permanent austerity (only for the poor) which has brought this new horror about.\\n\", u'\\nLars are you really? That is not nice. Do you need help?\\n', u\"\\nDumping an old man from Los Angeles in Hereford is a long way to dump anyone. People should look after their old folk and only take them to an old peoples home as a last resort, that is more likely to happen if they have to pay out thousands a week to put them in a home, if they are on benefits they won't care so much.\\n\", u'\\nYou are of course correct, as it is women who shoulder most responsibility for care but they really do deserve the highest respect for that.\\n', u'\\nLOL In fact ROFLMAOQuick now, answer me this: who cares for my children while I care for my parents? We are an unlucky family, we are poor, both of us have to work and even though our children are very young, we are both 40+, with parents who are old and need care - dementia diagnostic just came in a couple of months ago. How exactly do poor people manage to both work for a wage and stay at home for their parents?\\n', u'\\nIt wasn\\'t a Labour Prime Minister who said \"There is no such thing as society.\"\\n', u'\\nThen why bother voting?\\n', u'\\n\\nTories dump their elderly senile mothers at Claridges and pay for someone else to care for them.\\n\\nI bet very few if any of them pay the living wage and up.\\nIt would also not surprise me if many of them were claiming the costs on expenses either.\\n', u'\\n\\nAnd with no kids of my own, who looks after me?\\n\\nStart saving now. Or do you want be a burden on other people?\\n', u'\\nWe should all, of course, be caring for our own parents, teaching our own children, growing our own food, building our own houses, generating our own energy, treating our own illnesses, fixing our own teeth, writing our own books, making our own shoes, clothes, furniture, etc etc. Keep it in the family. Who needs other people anyway? What did they ever do for us?\\n', u'\\nWell, last time less than one in four of the electorate did. A more pertinent question might be: Why do we cling so desperately to an election system that gives a majority in the Commons to a party with that level of support?\\n', u'\\nThe article is downright nasty, as there are many people who push the boat out to look after much loved older members of their family. At some point it may be too much for them but at least they make the effort.\\n', u'\\nGrannies are not for dumping, we will seek revenge, come the revenge of the zimmer frames and walking sticks.We will smite you with our incontinence pads.Beware of the avenging Grannies and Grandads.\\n', u\"\\nI don't think that is being denied here and I agree good quality social care supports family ties and networks. However we need to be careful of putting families under unsustainable pressure to care for their loved ones, leaving them and their elderly relatives in a worse situation. That takes more than a lecture on personal responsibility\\n\", u'\\n\\nIt\\u2019s easy to idealise care but in reality it\\u2019s a complex thing \\u2013 a blend of love and duty, responsibility and gratitude\\n\\nThe only intelligent sentence in the entire piece. The Minister did not say that everyone must take care of their elderly relatives because state provision is about to end. What he did say is that people should have a sense of\\nduty, responsibility and gratitude to the people who have nurtured them and almost certainly have made sacrifices for them. Of course not everyone is able to do that and some elderly people get to the stage when they need professional care. But an awful lot more people could care for their own folk if they put their minds to it and maybe set aside their own interests for a while. Why that is an idea to generate frothing outrage defeats me.\\n', u'\\nI have no problem paying taxes to look after you but I also wanted to look after my relatives and did so. They were just a bit luckier than you to have me and in particular my wonderful wife, who continues to look after her mother in a way that no stranger could possibly do.\\n', u'\\nBecause they thought the alternative would be worse?\\n', u'\\nnah, they probably have blind trusts and accounts with mossack fonseca to pay out.\\n', u'\\nYou have my very sincere sympathy.\\n', u\"\\nMy relative 91 tomorrow is being dragged kicking and screaming into infirmity. She has fought her way back from 3 strokes and cancer and she has won the fight until last week-end when she had another massive stroke which this time left her unable to walk or feed herself. She is a strong woman and a fighter so has recovered enough to be released into a rehab environment where we hope she will recover enough to reclaim her dignity and life, she was still driving before the latest incident.I heard the nurse order her, whilst I was on the other end of the of the phone, to bed at 6pm last night, 'I want you in bed' she said. I was embarrassed as I knew how this would effect the person on the receiving end.It struck me how prevalent this attitude to ageing is. Yes she has been deathly ill and probably needs the rest but how much does it cost to say, perhaps it is time you had a rest now? No loss of dignity no loss of independence and no embarrassment in having your life now dictated. Many elderly are treated as a nuisance and fall into despair and death, especially if there is no family to stand beside them. It is sad and angering and pathetic that at the end of a life, a life that saw this lady in poverty through the war bring up 5 children alone and work three jobs to keep them and then thousands of hours of voluntary work, not valued and respected or at least respected. I can see a time coming when the elderly will be encouraged to euthanise, so disconnected from the suffering of others are we.\\n\", u\"\\nWhy did England vote Tory againDid they actually believe Thatcher's children would be any less malicious and callous than Thatcher?\\nAnd then they coted Tory again again.Especially the old people: after three or four years of already having the young deliberately turned against them by Tory rhetoric. \\nThere's an awful lot of masochism in England's cultural/political thinking.\\n\", u\"\\nThe scale of the problems this article hints at seems to be lost on many of those commenting. There is a huge cohort of aging people with complex care needs. That cohort had fewer children than earlier ones and those children are more likely to be geographically distant than previous generations and more likely to have had their own children later - so lots of those children aren't launched. The needs of people living into their late eighties and nineties very often cannot be met by family alone. There is an enormous but barely visible army of people, agencies, companies, health care facilities supplying uncoordinated bits of what's needed but this public/private/voluntary sector is so complicated and unevenly distributed that obtaining what's needed is a fulltime job on its own. There are many versions of nursing homes providing 24 hour care for helpless elderly patients, almost like a huge system of farming old people with enormous amounts of expensive inputs (medical care, pharmaceuticals, nursing, specialized services for OT, wheelchairs, nutrition, even entertainment, etc) where the outcome is... what? A lot of jobs and a lot of profit and a lot of what our extended old age really means kept from our sight. This is not going to be replaced by people caring for granny at home - not when granny had dementia, is wheelchair-bound and lives to 98 with careful medical management. Nor is the cost of it covered by whatever granny and granddad contributed before they retired 35 years ago. This is a much bigger problem than politicians like to discuss.\\n\", u\"\\nQuite right too and it's called playing the system. Plenty of people do it for many years, so why not old people in their dotage?\\n\", u'\\nI think dumping a confused person in a foreign country is nasty/ cruel / inhumane at the very least.\\n', u'\\nYes, I did - thanks for the reminder.

They are after all interested in profit profit profit and stuff what those at the bottom of our society get paid. Many of those at the top are also continually going on and on and on about lower taxes for themselves and then while paying those at the bottom a pittance they then have the audacity to complain about how big a share of the taxes they are paying without ever stopping to think of the irony that they could reduce their share by paying those at the bottom a proper level of wage rather than a poverty level of wage.\\nBut hey it is all about me me me and nothing in our society could ever stop families from being able to look after one another. It is not as if we have a rather draconian welfare system that continually looks to punish people and label them as workshy scroungers. It is not as if our society pays masses and masses of its workforce poverty levels of wages or expects huge swathes of the workforce to up and move away in the drive to look for work.\\nI could list many many many more examples of things that play a part in this issue.\\nBut no it must all be about me me me.\\nWhat will it take for you to open your eyes and take a good look around before you start labeling whole sections of society as being selfish?\\n\", u'\\nThe Camerons claimed Direct Payments from the local authority for the care of their disabled son.

The tax take is down. Not only are the rich paying less but wages are so low that the tax payer subsidises greedy employers by topping up wages with tax credits. 2. Perpetual rearranging of the deckchairs on the Titanic. Getting in lots of experts to manage inadequate resources won't make them grow. Instead it transfers public money into the pockets of incompetent organisations like G4S.3. How much did the idiot Duncan Smith's computer system waste? 4. Increased poverty not only reduces the tax take but also reduces demand thereby pushing more people into poverty up the line so that at the end there's just a small elite with inherited wealth and a mass of others with no hope and living in abject poverty.5. There are 2 sides to every budget, income and outgoings. As we all know when we have cut back as much as possible on outgoings the only solution is to increase income. If we want the economy to grow then the money needs to be more evenly distributed.\\n\", u'\\nYou may not have noticed, but there have been a few more prime ministers since Thatcher.\\n', u\"\\nYou know that these things didn't happen until June 2010.Corbyn for PM!\\n\", u'\\nYou are indeed most charming and eloquent as always, bifess :)\\n', u'\\nYou are quite right about the appallingly low value placed on care, formal as well as informal. And I challenge it whenever I can. The kindness and hard work of front-line care staff is much appreciated by many of us, but the exploitation of a predominantly female workforce needs continual challenging.\\n', u'\\nThis is the other side of the coin and a valid one at that. I worked in a nursing home for a number of years and have seen the kind of treatment you describe, sometimes to elderly clients who were the loveliest people imaginable. My husband wonders why I want to subscribe to Dignitias. I love him and I love my son, but from experience, I know better than to expect anything from them when systems begin to fail.\\n', u\"\\nWell, as Thatcher regularly said, 'if you can't afford it, you can't have it period'\\nShe used to add, that she'd learnt this at her father's knee, a Tory alderman, by the way, when people had ran out of food, and wanted things on tick in his grocery shop.\\nIIDS, May and co., certainly learnt a lot, at the knee of Thatcher.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nThe truth is though is that if we want healthcare and libraries then we need to agree a way to pay for them, not expect the money just to fall off the tree\\n\\nWell there are those of us that have little problem with paying increased taxation to have an infrastructure that serves us, I mean it works in other countries for those other countries to be described as amongst the happiest, so what's the problem?\\n\", u'\\nIn the same way an elderly person can experience health deterioration, so too could a young adult who sustained brain injury. Naturally, anyone who is ill to that degree will require care. However, the challenge for people in society is to see how the elderly contribute to society. They do so in many ways...\\nOlder people contribute \\xa361bn to economy\\nValuing the Socio-Economic Contribution of Older People in the UK\\nOlder people make a huge contribution to society. \\nThere are many stereotypical images of the elderly which in my view needs to be squashed. Just to add, I spent my life from the age of 15- 26 years, caring for my mother following a stroke. She had several, and moved from being a contributor to society to being in need of care by society.\\n', u'\\nThere is one way in which I do agree with the minister. It is to do with the bank of mum and dad or even leaving houses to their children. They have passed their wealth on to their children when some of it could have gone to pay for their care.

The handful of older folks I knew who worked at B+Q have all quit as a result of management diktats.\\n\", u'\\nI am not saying that the elderly, with or without Alzheimers or whatever, should not be loved and cherished, but it is a little emotive to simply say that they are a resource, when in many cases they are not.

But then it is typically not them that are going to be cut off when such services are cut to the bone.\\nI would have more sympathy for the Tories if they did not constantly tell lies like no top down reorganization of the NHS tell lies like they want our society to work for everyone. The evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that they want our society to work for all as time and time and time again they have taken from those at the bottom and then passed that on to those at the top.\\nWhy on earth anyone would trust a Tory politician is beyond me!\\n', u\"\\nA different, and more pertinent, question given the good news headlines about gdp growth is this: where's the money going?\\n\", u'\\n.....a bit rich given how your own comments so ably mix insults, racism and misogyny in equal measures.

For your child, there will be a place at an excellent school. As you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career for you with a decent income. As you look for that first home, we will make sure the Government is there to help. As you raise your family, we will help you with childcare. And as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement. \\nThroughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished National Health Service to give you the care you need.\\n at\\nhttps://www.conservatives.com/manifesto\\nIs it any wonder that our elected representatives (of various parties) are regarded as the lowest of the low, less trustworthy even than estate agents and bankers?https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3504/Politicians-trusted-less-than-estate-agents-bankers-and-journalists.aspx (from 2016, but going back to 1980s...)\\n\\nNew polling by Ipsos MORI shows that the British public are less likely to trust politicians to tell the than estate agents, bankers and journalists. \\nJust 16% of Britons trust politicians to tell the truth compared with 22% trusting journalists and estate agents and 31% who trust bankers.\\nThis question has been asked consistently since 1983, making it the longest-running series on trust in key professions in the UK. This helps highlight that low trust in politicians is long-standing: only 18% trusted them to tell the truth in 1983, and they reached a low point of only 13% trusting them in 2009, in the wake of the expenses scandal. \\n\\nIs it November 5th yet? Or is that too long to wait?\\n\", u\"\\nThere is no point making generalisations. Families have all sorts of different situations and there is no one answer. Some have money to make caring easier, others have little, some older people remain physically and mentally well, others don't and need professional care. Some have children, some don't. Some carers have health problems. Caring can be lonely and very hard work. Providing support from the state for those who have neither the financial, physical or mental resources, or have no relatives is part of being a civilised society\\n\", u'\\n\\nPeople need to see the elderly as a huge resource.

Or hiring nannies while they pursue careers that are on the up. Working parents is encouraged even if you have young children get back to work put them in the nursery So why be negative about some families expecting elderly care for their relatives so they can carry on in the labour market to support their own children Not all older people want their children and grandchildren to give up their whole lives to look after them\\n', u'\\nWe do do as you say, already. \\nYour anecdote is touching and resonates with lots of people. \\nThe Tories are slashing budgets.

But, more generally I do get pissed off at how this disproportionately affects women.

My mum was the main carer for the four of us, plus during that time she took in my dad\\'s grandma. Now my dad has health problems so she\\'s focused on that. My dad\\'s mum is in a care home because how much can my mum actually fucking do? Also they don\\'t really get on lol.

In order to do so I paid the loan on a car for my mum as they lived very rural at a time when the cost really caused me a lot of difficulty. The house needed work so I eventually paid for mortgage to do it up for my mum who was disabled and to build an annexe for my minimum wage earning brother to live in. When my mum died (suddenly, after my years of effort to be in a position to look after her when she became old) I took over all the bills so my brother can stay there. \\nYou don\\'t actually have to live with them or physically care for them.

It's a challenge for society to fragment further and for people who can afford it to look after their own. Which was kind of the point of the Thatcherite quote you allude to, and the reason why many people on 'the left' find that worldview so odious. \\nThe people who believe in society, who want society to prove it exists, are the people who see Mowat's hypocrisy for what it is, and want to make sure that the state continues to contribute its fair share in looking after its most vulnerable.\\n\", u'\\nWell bang her on the head now then?\\nOr possibly assume that if she is still alive at 90 you can be fit enough at 73 to care for her?\\n', u'\\nYour friend has good taste in books.\\n', u'\\nExcept the call is not for society to shoulder its responsibility, but the exact opposite. And she is usually quoted correctly, and in context.\\n', u'\\nCouldn\\'t agree more. I\\'ve already commented on another thread on this subject today, having helped my wife care in our home for my aged grandmother who was in her nineties at the same time as we had three teenage daughters living at home. Later, after they had left home, we cared for my mother and then my mother in law. It was a combination of much hard work and a lot of laughter.

There\\'s little doubt that many more people could do what we did but they don\\'t have the commitment or love. Some are simply just selfish\\nIt can\\'t work for everyone though and care services, in the home or residential care, will continue to be needed.\\nWe get a chance every five years to set our national spending priorities at a General Election so surely the question has to be asked, \"Why do the people of this country keep electing a government whose sole aim is to placate the very rich but apply austerity to everyone else?\"\\n Vote Tory and things can only get worse.

Bellissimo.....\\n\", u'\\nI think that the point is, we have modelled our society on achievement of the self. For a start that is often manifested by living hundreds if thousands of miles from parents, therefore straight away you are outsourcing all care to the state. Whilst many people do have terrible stories of hardship, many people do not, and those people are doing the outsourcing that has become a normal mode of behaviour.\\n', u\"\\nWhat a revolutionary idea to look after one's own parents.\\n\", u\"\\nIgnoring the fact that it is often misquoted and taken out of context, Margaret Thatcher's comment that there is no such thing as society provoked shrieks of outrage from every corner of the left.Yet now, in the face of a challenge for society to step up and shoulder some responsibility, or in other words to prove that it does exist, we are bombarded with howls of disgust from the left. There is a point where inconsistency becomes hypocrisy, and it would do the left a great service if it made itself more aware of where that line lies. And gave us all a break from its constant synthetic indignation.\\n\", u\"\\nAnything to avoid having to actually go after unpaid taxes, or to not cut gaxes for the already ludicrously wealthy.

What if you have no children? Do those elders with families now get a higher quality of care than those that don't?

So many families have been hugely fragmented for generations.That's the nature of modern life, you cannot look after your folks if you moved 200 miles away, or to Australia.The fact is that our society has been driven by hyper individualism for decades now and this is a symptom of that. Now that the Ponzi scheme is collapsing we need to consider how to survive post welfare....\\n\", u\"\\nI don't see why he's saying families should look after their elderly parents, and not the state, as unless the parents are down to nothing more than \\xa323,500 in both assets (eg, property) and savings, the parents are going to have to pay for their own care anyway!\\nAn if you are only worth nothing more than \\xa323k then why should your children give up their lives to provide you with free care, when you already own so little.\\n\", u\"\\nDo all older people have children? Many are childless or have outlived their children. Do all children have the resources in time and money to care completely for their parents? No, most people of working age do not. Almost everyone has to work full-time to be able to survive, eat and keep a roof over their head. Many working age people live where the work is, which may be far from where their parents are. If they quit work to look after their parents, are the Tories going to give them benefits to allow them to do so? I doubt it. \\nAn older person with little mobility, or with dementia, or with serious health troubles, requires a LOT of care, every hour and every day of the week. While it may be true that women sometimes performed this role in the past, it's also true that almost no one lived to an advanced old age even 100 years ago. Current life-spans are unprecedented. Old people today have made a huge contribution to society, and the most effective and efficient way to support them is for society as a whole to play a very large role. \\nThe tories are just trying to palm off a responsibility that belongs to all of us, through taxation, onto individuals who are already over-burdened, so they can crack on with selling the NHS to their pals.\\n\", u\"\\nSo, Minister David Mowat, in receipt of a handsome salary, and possessed of an interesting, stimulating job, is going to chuck that all in, and for the princely sum of \\xa362.10 a week (Carer's Allowance), will spend the next umpteen years of his life looking after his ancient mum and dad - who may have dementia (so they probably won't sleep at night), and any number of any physical illnesses and disability (including that joy, double incontinence!), and devote his entire life, 24x7 doing NOTHING ELSE except look after two very, very old and infirm people?????\\nI don't think he will, dear readers, do you??????????????\\n\", u'\\n\" There is something in their ... worldview that appeals to people... put yourself first, a mantra which far too many people find irresistible.\"\\nIt that surprising... really?\\nThere is something in what you say but I\\'ve struck out some of the \\'unhelpful\\' words. You need to learn to do that. \\nThe majority of sane people with a non nihilistic bent vote for what they believe to be best for themselves, their families, now (first) and in the future. Every side plays on the base instinct of fear, which can be used to trump (I thank you!) reason. That\\'s why polls are often wrong. People say what they think should be the right choice, but often revert to gut instinct. That is the second thing to understand.\\nThere has to be balance between complete selfishness at one extreme and complete self-sacrifice at the other. Both are as bad for the individual and society. Recent events show that people think the pendulum has swung too far to the latter. That doesn\\'t mean most people want it to swing entirely the other way, or even a significant swing. That\\'s the third thing the more rabid in btl don\\'t understand, or don\\'t want to.\\nWe\\'ve seen what happens when a rebalance goes wrong, with a valid reaction to what was happening in the U.K. In the 70s. A swing to Thatcherism over a long period not a nudge in the right (again no pun intended) direction.\\nSurely, the best thing people of good intent and reason can do, is find the common ground to keep whoever is in power on their toes rather than enhance the division that works in their favour?\\n', u'\\nNo, you will be cared for in the state system like everybody in your circumstances. Those with families however, deserve to be looked after by the people they have loved and cherished their whole lives.\\n', u'\\nNo, you said the elderly were a resource, I am just asking what you mean by resource.\\n', u\"\\nMost elderly people paid into the system all their working lives, believing they would be cared for in their old age .\\nThey put faith in a political system which told them they would be cared for.\\nI don't know anyone who does not do all they can for their parents, but there comes a time when specialist help is required .\\nThese out of touch Tories do not have a clue how stressful the lives of most working families today are, and how hard it is just to give their own kids quality time !\\n\", u'\\nI am already in the scrapheap!\\n', u'\\nWHOOSH\\n', u\"\\nMy kids got me some Dignitas vouchers for Xmas . . . maybe that' s the way to go.\\n\", u'\\nIt might be that the person who is in need of care (particularly if it is of an intimate nature) would rather it was not done by a family member. \\nHaving a neurological disorder, it is highly likely that I will need at least a degree of care in years to come. In conjunction with family and friends I have various plans in place and I would hate for either my siblings or beloved nephews to feel obligated to look after me.

Some parents will do well at home, others require 24hr nursing care. One size does not fit all.

Many of us did just that, and as a consequence families are disperessed across the UK, and around the world.

No idea what the current Labour 'leadership' think.\\n\", u'\\nSo you value life by what a person can contribute when they are well.

Plus, they tend to forget that the children of 85 year olds are typically 65.However, and I hope I don\\u2019t get too much flank for it but makes you think, I am equally shocked how little people care for their parents once they are in paid care. Is it really too much to ask to call your parents once per fortnight or visit them? Yes, if you live far away, you have an excuse. But no excuse to not call.Is it really too much to ask if the care home calls you and tells you that mum needs new knickers because no matter how much you wash them, due to her incontinence they are all brown now, to get out and buy 10 pairs from ASDA? Yes, even old \\u201cdiddies\\u201d with high dementia notice that they are not \\u201cclean\\u201d. Especially if that person was always house proud and looked after herself.This Christmas we had 2 people being invited to spend Christmas with their family. The rest could not even cope with great grandma for a few hours. 5 others at least had the decency to visit.I had to aid people with eating while the visiting children were sitting next to me. Their excuse for not doing it: \\u201cIts your job and mum spits so I might get dirty\\u201d.Get off your bloody phone if you visit Dad for 15 minutes each fortnight. No one asks you for more. Are you on your phone if your children want to play with you or ask questions?Yes, you might not like Dad. He was a real bastard and now he has dementia he is even more challenging. You cant face visiting him. That\\u2019s fine. We know he was a bastard because he is also a bastard now. We hear each day what you have to suffer your whole life. No one blames you. Send him one a fortnight a card with a cheesy message and cute cat pictures. He likes that. It makes him mellow: \\u201cLook what my son send me\\u201d.If you want good care for your parents but don\\u2019t want to give up a job, look at day care.There is so much going on in care for the elderly. Too many people who should not be responsible for care are taking it in. Too few people care for their parents because it is \\u201coutsourced\\u201d.There has to be a middle way.And to the ones who scream: Its a feminist issue why should I care for my parents. Good on you. You have my support. You go, girls. But please consider that the majority of (paid) carers are women and you only deem them to be worth the minimum wage. And look down at them.\\n', u'\\n\"Shared\" is the operative word here.

It's just about being selfish.\\n\", u'\\nWhy is social responsibility something that should be shouldered by the state and not shared by the family?\\n', u\"\\nI think what the Tory supporters are trying to say is they don't want to have to have to pay more into the state to pay for anyone else.\\nWhich is fine, if you have that mindset.\\n\", u\"\\nWasn't it the arch nemesis of the left who defined socialists as experts at spending other people's money, until it ran out?\\n\", u\"\\n'Oh those evil Tories, It's so easy to vilify them isn't it?'.\\nYes.\\n\", u\"\\nFor many reasons, people might have endure physical and mental abuse from them?\\nNot everyone's life is like an episode of the Waltons.\\n\", u'\\nIs that because you are better than us?\\n', u\"\\nA lot of these elderly people have paid into the system all their working lives. Part of that pact was the state provides for them when they need it. Don't take the money if you have no intention of keeping your side of the deal.\\n\", u'\\nOh those evil Tories, It\\'s so easy to vilify them isn\\'t it?\\nThe truth is though is that if we want healthcare and libraries then we need to agree a way to pay for them, not expect the money just to fall off the tree. We need to agree priorities because not everything is possible. And in the case of libraries getting a few more people to use them might make the case for funding them a bit firmer.\\nThe language needs to change. Every time I see a piece talking of \"devastating cuts\" I switch off. I\\'ve been hearing that for thirty years and government spending is still at the same level. What I might respond to is someone saying \"these are our priorities and this is how we propose to fund them\".\\nAnd, though politicians will fight the idea, we need to start having hypothecated taxes - taxes raised for specific purposes.\\n', u'\\nOh so they should have looked after him?\\n', u\"\\nTories are strong on moralising- as long as it's not their morals they're talking about. Those who talk like Mowat can usually afford to pay someone else to do the caring.\\n\", u'\\nSo why are so eager to shove them in the care of the state?\\n', u\"\\nWhy shouldn't people look after their relatives if they can?\\n\", u'\\nPeople need to see the elderly as a huge resource. An African saying...\\n\"The death of an elder is like the burning of a library\".\\n', u'\\nIn the words of either Harry or Sally, you need to get \"out there\".\\nQuite fast.\\n', u\"\\nThe countries you mention are all ones where women don't traditionally work.\\n\", u\"\\nIt's a pity you can no longer have the scales removed from your eyes by the NHS, but that's cuts for you!\\n\", u'\\n\\nIn Italy, India, Japan, Pakistan etc it is normal to have ones grandparents living with you\\n\\nJapan and Italy have two of the lowest birthrates in the world.\\nJapan is effectively bottom (as lower Monaco is an outlier with its post-fertile ageing rich) and Italy is 11.\\nIt is crystal clear what women in these nations think of such arrangements.\\nAll this mansplaining about the wonders of \"intergenerational living\" always just makes women roll their eyes.\\n', u\"\\nIt has always amazed me, that people of a 'conservative' mind seem not to understand that one person can't do the same as five. As an example: One couple with average income. Three children of school age. Two sets of elderly parents who need caring for. Quite often it is the woman in the house for whom this falls to, particularly if the husband is in full time work, and is the main breadwinner. She may even have a part-time job to make ends meet. In this case the woman may be caring for seven people, plus going to work. Fair? I think not!When will government misters, of whatever colour, realise that most hard working people are not living off inherited wealth, not do they have shares in big business, nor do they get yearly bonuses only fairies could dream of. Why should they not be given some help, while others are paying no tax, but creaming off the surplus of society, and sunning themselves on the rivieras in far flung places?\\n\", u'\\nUnless, of course, they reign-in the ludicrously bloated foreign aid budget to support our own local council services and future spending on care for the elderly.\\n', u'\\nSo why did you post it?\\n', u\"\\nMe neither; I have no family - at least none I've seen in years. Judging from other articles, and the number of people who die alone, its not that unusual.\\n\", u'\\nThis is the Conservatives we are talking about here. Is anyone really surprised?\\n', u'\\nBut true\\n', u\"\\nwithout expenditure on own parents or on children, one would assume that you will be expected to save and use those those savings or 'cashing in of assets' as you age to fund your retirement or care.... those (with children) with a home of their own are expected to use it to fund nursing home care unless a dependent spouse/child lives in it etc. Here in Australia, the LNP government makes sounds every so often abut pensions and benefits needing to be only for the 'most needy' ... one ends to expect that at some stage they will try and compel pensioners to hack into their only exempt asset - their home - to fund their retirement/aged care - forgetting that it cannot do both in most cases and that many elderly women (often outlive their partners if they ever had one) keep their home 'in reserve' for aged care (having seen the alternative level of low care in some places when looking for care for elderly relatives when they themselves are not in a position to care themselves (children, lack of adequate housing, partner objects etc). After my dad's death, my own mother cared for her father and mother in law until they died (apart from last few months of my demented gm's life when she had to go into care and slipped fell, broke hip, died of pneumonia). My mother swore she would never do that to us her daughters - nor did she want to be in an institution such as her m-i-l was in: so she stayed in her own home (we visited, stayed; my sister made meals each week for her etc) until her death, although crippled with rheumatoid arthritis. Help to stay at home has to be affordable and saves the state and taxpayers millions ... but expecting all families to be as my mother in caring for elderly relatives is totally unrealistic. There are dysfunctional families and families were old wounds are easily opened. There are families where especially under great financial and emotional pressure, elder abuse will occur... The State does have a role to play - adn not just as an 'enforcer' when things go horribly wrong.\\n\", u\"\\nFor the fate of the elderly in a society run on these lines, see last night's Panorama about the unfortunate Roger Curry, an American abandoned by his family in England.\\n\", u\"\\nTory MPs either build a granny-annexe on expenses or get the LA to pay care home fees for their elderly relatives. Good with money - other people's money that is.\\n\", u'\\nOf course it is... \\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/06/three-deaths-worcestershire-royal-hospital-nhs-winter-crisis\\n', u'\\nThe Tories always use try to use guilt and shame as weapons to shrink the role of the state. If we want anything from them from heathcare to Libraries, we are greedy, entitled and it\\'s made clear that we all have a responsibility to vilify anyone trying to take \\'more than their share\\'. \\nMeanwhile they stuff their faces while our backs are turned. Tory policy now as ever seems to be \\'Lie, guilt trip, lie again to justify cuts, lie again when we object, enact cuts, lie about results\\'\\nEvery single time the truth is told about the devastating effect the cuts are having, all we get is the same old lies trotted out. \"Complicated causes, no direct link can be proven, misleading to suggest, more/less and better than ever before\\' .....\\n', u'\\nRidiculous comment.\\n', u'\\nPerhaps Tories needs a reminder that taking responsibilities for one\\u2019s parents\\u2019 doesn\\u2019t mean state exemption from providing care to its citizens of all ages.\\n', u\"\\nPeople vote for them. There is something in their vicious worldview that appeals to people. Don't think about others, put yourself first, a mantra which far too many people find irresistible. We are condemned to living in a world ruled by this.\\n\", u\"\\nFrom the cradle to the grave . It's the State .\\nNo thanks.\\n\", u'\\nA multi-generational home is very common in most of the world. In Italy, India, Japan, Pakistan etc it is normal to have ones grandparents living with you and for care work for both the young and old to be shared across the generations. Of course in Britain everyone wants to live in their own private little units so it is impossible to do this and as a result massive tax hikes will be needed to get everyone else to pay for outsourced care.\\n', u'\\nWill we get 15 hours a week free care for everyone over 65 then?\\n', u\"\\nOf course it is, it's how they dump yours not theirs, they can afford to pay, for the rest of us it's DIY. The only way to provide care for the elderly is collective social provision via taxes, so what's wrong with that you ask ?. The Tories don't want to pay taxes for collective social provision or public services so they think they can just walk away as a government and say nothing to do with us. \\nThey want tax cuts for the rich, not for the rest of us, all they care about is money, don't take notice of what they say but what they do and the result, six years of cuts \\xa34.6bn in cuts to Social care that's what they decided to do and it had nothing to do with economics it was purely political and don't fall for the we can't afford it argument we can they choose not to, so what does that say about them as people maybe Nye Bevan was right, they haven't changed. Same old Tories !\\n\", u\"\\nAs I've posted before, this is evidence of shocking incompetence on the part of the Tories. We're into their second term in government yet debt is spiralling out of control while they cut and cut and cut. \\nThey represent themselves as competent to manage the UK economy yet all the evidence shows exactly the opposite. They have no money for social care, none for nurseries, recycling schemes are being cut back - everything that might make a 'shared' society - never mind a 'big' one - has been and continues to be slashed and burned. \\nSingularly the worst administration in post-war history. Even Callaghan began to turn things round after the oil crisis and IMF loan crises. \\nTo acknowledge that the current Tory government is worse than labour of the mid 70s is surely the worst indictment any serving administration could be lumped with. \\nDisgraceful, incompetent charlatans who couldn't be trusted to buy a pair of shoelaces, never mind steer an isolated UK through the stormy seas of a rapacious globalised economic system.\\n\", u'\\nYou sound lovely.\\n', u\"\\nIt's insulting to suggest that we don't already take care of our elderly as best we can!\\n\", u\"\\n\\nA government minister saying that it should be the responsibility of families to look after ageing parents looks like just another way of abdicating from state care\\n\\nYup.\\nHeard LBC teeing it up this morning like it is some kind of irreversible fact that cannot be challenged. There's even some website setup on how children should save for the care of their parents.\\n\", u'\\nTricky situation.\\nI wish you all the very best for the future @ACJB - and remember, 40s is young!\\n']\n",

politicians deploy the language of responsibility you can be sure they\\u2019re going to try to shirk theirs. So\\xa0it was when the government minister <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/31/take-care-of-your-elderly-mothers-and-fathers-says-tory-minister\" title=\"\">David Mowat, speaking on Monday to the House of Commons local government select committee</a>, hit on an idea for solving the crisis in the funding of social care, especially for old people.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>\\u201cNo one ever questions that we look after our children... no one says that is a caring responsibility.\\u201d And that logic, Mowat said, \\u201cwill have to impinge on the way that we think about caring for our parents.\\u201d So what\\u2019s wrong with his proposal? First of all, it infantilises old people and perpetuates the stereotype of old age as a second childhood \\u2013 at a stroke erasing whole lifetimes of experience and skill.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Caring for children and old people is comparable only in the most superficial way, in that bodily needs can become more urgent in the early and later stages of life. Otherwise the sensibilities required are completely different (especially in the case of a parent with dementia), as anyone who has\\xa0done both can testify.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The other thing they share is that most of the caring, for young and old, is carried out by women \\u2013 often at the same time. As the country greys itself (women having children later, parents living longer), this double responsibility can be as stressful as it is rewarding. Mowat didn\\u2019t mention gender \\u2013 perhaps he just assumed it. If you\\u2019re asking families to take on more elder care, how are you going to square this with more women entering the labour market, through choice or necessity or both? I\\xa0can\\u2019t help wondering whether lurking beneath Mowat\\u2019s solution is an attempt to transfer women\\u2019s work from the labour market into the home.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>More divorce, smaller families, the necessity of two mortgage-paying incomes, the policy to delay retirement \\u2013 how do these sit alongside taking on more care for the elderly? Crucially, there are now more <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/cohort-fertility--england-and-wales/2012/sty-cohert-fertility.html\" title=\"\">women without children </a>than ever: are they expected to look after their ageing parents without any prospect of having it reciprocated by their own children? Even policies such as the bedroom tax, the cost of public transport and the reduction in post-Brexit immigration \\u2013 all, on the face of it, age-neutral \\u2013 affect our capacity to look after others.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>In east Asia, where the Confucian idea of filial piety is enshrined not only in the moral code but also the law, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/15/china-grey-tide-elderly-people\" title=\"\">China now has an elderly rights law</a> that requires children to visit their ageing parents \\u2013 although it isn\\u2019t clear how this is going to be enforced (presumably it\\u2019s not something that they\\u2019re doing voluntarily or it wouldn\\u2019t have to be enshrined in law). Young Japanese have coined a new phrase: <em>Kaigo-jigoku</em>, the \\u201c<a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/28/japan-elderly-care-mutual-support\" title=\"\">care-giving hell</a>\\u201d of those who look after their relatives.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>It\\u2019s easy to idealise care but in reality it\\u2019s a complex thing \\u2013 a blend of love and duty, responsibility and gratitude. Many people describe the time spent with an ageing parent as one of the most nourishing: an opportunity to speak the hitherto unspoken and make one\\u2019s peace. Yet not all family relationships conform to this template, and even if they do the balance between respect and resentment can be a delicate one.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>In western countries the \\u201cburden\\u201d discourse has become increasingly inescapable. In her stirring new book, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/ending-ageism-or-how-not-to-shoot-old-people/9780813589282\" title=\"\">Ending Ageism, or How Not to Shoot Old People</a> (to be published this summer), the pioneering US writer Margaret Morganroth Gullette argues that the meaning of the word burden has shifted from referring to the demanding work of care-giving (expressing empathy with the carer) on to the recipient of care. No wonder so many older people worry that they\\u2019ll become burdensome, and elder abuse is becoming so common. This week saw a novel version of it: the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/30/wife-son-dumped-roger-curry-dementia-uk-car-park\" title=\"\">\\u201cgranny-dumping\\u201d </a>of an old man from Los Angeles with dementia, allegedly abandoned in a car park in Hereford.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Beneath Mowat\\u2019s rhetoric lies the individualising of care and the state\\u2019s growing abdication of its responsibility for the health and wellbeing of\\xa0old people. It seems that we can\\u2019t \\u2013 in\\xa0the fifth largest economy in the world \\u2013 afford for people to grow older with their sense of self and basic human rights intact. A staggering <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-news/12m-older-people-dont-get-the-social-care-they-need/\" title=\"\">1.2 million older people don\\u2019t get the social care they need</a> \\u2013 a rise of 48% since 2010.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>It doesn\\u2019t have to be like this. All the evidence shows that old people do much better when they\\u2019re socially engaged and supported \\u2013 when cities and towns are made age-friendly and when public resources are made available to maintain them in their own\\xa0home. In the long term this also saves money, as well as lives. We\\u2019re living, though, not in a \\u201cbig society\\u201d but a small one; ours isn\\u2019t a shared society either, only a withholding one.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<div

      "comment_text [u'\\nThank you.\\n', u'\\nComments on this thread will close shortly - thanks for your contributions so far.\\n', u'\\n\"Judging by the sound, fury and righteous indignation of the Liberals and remainers in this country they fear that May\\'s brexit strategy is working, or else they would be jumping up and down with glee.\"\\nNo.. because we\\'d be no better than the Leavers then. Let\\'s try something that doesn\\'t involve projecting your own shallow world view, shall we?\\nRemainers believe that leaving the EU is both wrongheaded and self-injurious. Wrongheaded because it\\'s for the wrong reasons and self-injurious because in the long run, it will do more damage than it will provide benefits. \\nUnfortunately, remainers are being dragged along with the leavers in this impending trainwreck whether we want to or not. Worse, the Leave side has decided that with a mere 1.9% win, they have 100% support, so there\\'s no need to discuss anything with anyone, take any other views in to account or worry about anyone who doesn\\'t agree.\\nSo.. I\\'d like you to picture the remainer\\'s world for a moment. You\\'re trapped in a TGV bullet train. You didn\\'t want to be on it, but you\\'ve no way out. The train is pulling out of the station and is speeding up quickly... and heading for a wall at ever quicker speeds. When you point out that there\\'s a wall on the track, the other passengers and the crew insist you\\'re delusional and just want to derail the train, reminding us that THEY run the train now. You look out the front window and there\\'s the wall, looming larger and larger and still no one will listen - and worse, the train is still speeding up...\\nThat\\'s what it\\'s like for every remainer. It\\'s easy to fix: explain to us exactly why the wall isn\\'t really there. How does Brexit make anything honestly and materially better - no platitude about \\'make Britain great again\\' because to us, Britain already WAS great. The Britain you seem to want is, to us, antiquated and crufty... a fictional history from 1945 that has little relevance in 2017.\\nThing is, when we ask - all we get back is \\'trust us\\' and \\'make Britain better\\'... oh and.. \\'them damn immigrants\\'.. which also doesn\\'t work because we LIKE immigrants and cultural diversity.\\nUntil that\\'s fixed, it will continue being Leave and Remain... because fundamentally, we have two different idea of what a \"Great Britain\" should be.\\nWhat could have happened would be to use the referendum as the advice it was supposed to be and start a national discussion on how we want the country to go and what solutions were possible. For example, we don\\'t manage the non-EU immigration well enough, which actually accounts for more than half of all immigrants to the UK each year. That didn\\'t even come up until after the referendum.\\n', u'\\nThe predictions of Brexit were based on the immediate Article 50 that Cameron promised. Ergo no prediction has been disproven but our currency is now worth a lot less.\\nExtra cringe points for using the clich\\xe9d \"narrative\" phrase and presuming to speak for remain voters, too.\\n', u\"\\nSign plenty of trade deals\\nAh that mantra again! Sign away ... it's the negotiating that's going to take decades. What do you plan to do meanwhile, other than starve?\\n\", u\"\\nClueless and out of her depth.\\nAll the idiocy and short sightedness of Cameron but even weaker and more desperate.\\nShe would sell the UK down at Cash Converters rather than admit she's making a terrible mistake.\\nBeyond pathetic, beyond parody.\\nWe're just going to have to sit back and wait to pick up the pieces.\\nIn 5 years very few will admit they voted Brexit, just as very few admit they supported the Iraq invasion.\\n\", u\"\\nSince you ask? Top of Trump's wish list will be the NHS. If you control the NHS, you control the whole population. Think about life without the NHS, and if you only have access to health care if you qualify under the exclusivity rules of an American health insurance company. So, thank you Farage, Gove, Johnson et al. Thank you Theresa May for selling our backsides to Trump and thank you Steve Bannon for making it all possible by data-mining voters' profiles with your OCEAN programme at Cambridge Analyica, of which you are a Board Member!\\n\", u'\\nHear, hear! Stop the madness now!\\n', u'\\n\"Tell you what. You buy our chlorinated chicken \\u2013 very clean, by the way, very clean \\u2013 and yeah, we can talk about your shortbread. And those mugs with the queen on. I like those. Ok? We done? I think we\\'re done.\"\\n', u'\\nLove your handle\\n', u\"\\nIt ain't looking good at all but it's always darkest just before dawn. Just got to make the best of it.\\n\", u'\\n\"Project Fear\" - a disparaging term used by people who were taken in by decades of tabloid fear-mongering to describe those who weren\\'t, ironically enough - will turn out to be \"Project Understatement\", mark my words. \\nChrist, I\\'d love to meet you for a beer in five years!\\n', u'\\nFalling apart seem to indicate an undignified and ugly conclusion; I would much prefer the end to arrive as a result of successive democratic referenda.\\nAnd because I believe the EU has failed as a political project. I dislike its protectionist nature, I dislike the failures of the single currency, I dislike the lack of accountability, and I disliked its anti-democratic behaviour with regards to the Lisbon Treaty.\\n', u\"\\nUnfortunately, Trudeau doesn't have the luxury of snubbing Trump, not with him holding NAFTA renegotiations over Canada's collective head like the sword of Damocles. He can subtly try to push him like he did on the weekend, but Trudeau has to walk an absolute tightrope with Trump. There's ideas being floated around about how Canada could react to Trump's ban, like bringing refugees that have already gone through American security clearance to Canada instead, but Trump is so unpredictable any move Trudeau makes could antagonize Trump with disastrous consequences. And Canadians for the most part despise everything about Trump, so if Trudeau tries to appease him on bilateral issues, the Canadian electorate will come down on Trudeau like a tonne of bricks. If you think May is in tough with Trump, Trudeau's in just as bad a spot if not worse\\n\", u'\\nThe Daily Heil is a rabble rouser.\\n', u'\\nThey are all still losing custom.\\n', u'\\nThere are none\\n', u\"\\nTrump has at least proved one thing, he did not lie during his election campaign about his intentions, he meant it all and if he gets his way all his nasty promises will be implemented. It also becomes increasingly obvious that the (unaccountable to very little) Bannon has a lot of unrestricted power, and seems to be emerging as Trump's puppet master!\\n\", u'\\nWell said and spot on.\\n', u\"\\nWell it must be true if it's in the Daily Mail\\n\", u'\\nThat would be like siding with the school buddy because he/she is stronger. Rarely a tactic hat ends well for anyone.\\n', u\"\\nIn a post-Brexit world, will Ocado's robot soon be picking your shopping? Yes, if they use the same big data analysis methods as Cambridge Analytica, they will, and much, much more besides. Cambridge Analytica, according to the tech platform Motherboard, are responsible for delivering the Brexit and Trump election successes. Here's a claim from their website: 'At Cambridge Analytica we use data modeling and psychographic profiling to grow audiences, identify key influencers, and connect with people in ways that move them to action.' 'Move them to action?' Like the Big Lie? As in voting a certain way? They have offices in the UK, and here's the really chilling bit to make even your robot's toes curl: Steven Bannon, Trumps' senior policy advisor, is on the Board of Cambridge Analytica! How do you feel about Farage, VoteLeave and Brexit now? Here's the article at Motherboard. http://motherboard.vice.com/read/big-data-cambridge-analytica-brexit-trump\\n\", u\"\\nIt's hard to take an article like this seriously given every other article in the past year about Brexit. Every prediction wrong, practically every sentiment wrong. It would be much better if we had something about unifying solutions. Narratives suggesting a cancelling of Brexit only alienates the rest of the country. Everybody I know, whether remainer or leaver, wants to get on with it and make a success of it.\\n\", u'\\nHow else can one account for the PM `pimping`the Queen so soon into this administration? It was a really stupid ploy and I am ashamed that we appear so needy in wanting to win favour with this narcissist...he seems somewhat unhinged.\\n', u\"\\nWeirdly I can make up my own mind after reading numerous articles in various publications that it is going to be a disaster The daily fail is a gossip rag at best you won't find any news in it\\n\", u'\\nTrading block?\\n', u'\\nSalutations. ........ Outstanding deluded Brexshittery at its most sublime\\n', u'\\nAnd up it pops...\\n', u\"\\n\\nJust look at Germany's increasingly tense relationship with the US to see where gobbing off gets you.\\n\\nGermany's reaction to the Donald was pretty low-key and in no way comparable to, say, Mexican official. The aggression clearly originates in the US, could have something to do with the US trade deficit with Germany. Just a hint.\\n\", u\"\\nWhen have our 'friends' in the EU ever lifted a finger to help us ?.... And you're not dreaming - just being an Obtuse Liberal.....\\n\", u'\\nKippers are Tories.\\n', u'\\n\\nThis country has been held hostage by Tory rightwing Euro-sceptics for forty years.\\n\\nWhat about the 13 years that the Labour Party were in charge?\\n', u'\\nPutin must be beside himself with delight. The USA riven with divisions and the EU and NATO teetering on the brink ...\\n', u\"\\nWhat's the difference between falling apart and the end of it?\\nStill. Why would you like that?\\n\", u'\\nWhat on earth will come of a \"trade deal\" with the US - what will they want to buy from the UK that they do not already have? The clear \"make America great again\" policy means that they will only want to export to us without being charged tarriffs.A crock of shit to be sure.One can only admire Angela Merkel for having the balls to tell Trump which way is up, instead of kow-towing to him in the ay that May the appeaser does.I am surprised f she can sleep at night, whatever happened to principles?\\n', u'\\nI find it quite creepy that Bannon is always standing behind Trump.\\nBest position for pulling the strings.\\n', u\"\\nIt's called democracy.\\n\", u\"\\nJudging by the sound, fury and righteous indignation of the Liberals and remainers in this country they fear that May's brexit strategy is working, or else they would be jumping up and down with glee. They have even resorted to the desperate measure of trying to sour relations between this country and our most important defence and security partner by far, definitely not the actions of patriots. May's meeting with Trump committed the UK to nothing apart from a symbolic state visit which is accorded to every US president, although earlier than normal.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nThat will be the perfect time to provoke those who are capable of launching a major terror attack \\n\\nThere have been countless terrorist attacks before May and Trump came to power - I don't think terrorists need much of an excuse to want to kill others.\\n\", u'\\nLast circulation from December 2016\\nThe Guardian sold approx 160,000 copies a dayTimes, 550,000Telegraph, 750,000Daily Mail, 1,300,000\\n', u'\\nTheresa May you had better watch out for TrickyDicklessDon..\\n', u'\\nObama employed all the men in suits who almost brought the entire western economy down and who profited from it personally.\\n', u'\\nFrom a major power in the world\\'s richest trading block to vassal state to Trump\\'s regime. All summed up in that pathetic plea to him for affirmation by Gove: \"And now we\\'re at the front of the queue?\", to which he gets the meaningless response: \"I think you\\'re doing great!\". Welcome to Airstrip One... Enjoy your European-standard workers\\' rights while we\\'re still in the EU ladies and gents, and don\\'t say the TUC didn\\'t warn you before the referendum coz they did - repeatedly and unambiguously.\\n', u'\\nI am an expert and Theresa May is not a Kipper.\\n', u\"\\nWell, Britain doesn't get to decide who the American people - or any people - elect as their leader.\\nBritain certainly doesn't, but America might very well get a lot to decide what's happening in Britain. Hence the sarcastic comments about 'taking back control'.\\n\", u\"\\nMore to the point what's the people's view on the unelected media's involvement in UK politics?\\n\", u\"\\nFake news, he doesn't want to destroy NATO, he just doesn't want to have to pay when the rest won't pay. It's not that difficult to understand.I think you are comparing him to a politician, he has different rules\\n\", u\"\\nIt wouldn't amuse me that the EU falls apart; but I do support the end of it as a political project.\\n\", u'\\nPoliticians are always going to be okay, whatever comes to pass they like cockroaches they always survive\\n', u\"\\nIf Mr Trump's America is our best ally, then let's hope he keeps up his antics a while longer. Maybe the British people will start seeing the EU in a better light, when its compared with the world outside it. Maybe they might even just get to realise that Brexit is a disaster........whoops, must be dreaming again.....\\n\", u'\\nThe Daily Mail is also losing custom\\n', u'\\nExcept that everything positive that you have referred to is to do with her potential electoral success. Some things are more important than that.\\n', u\"\\nWell you can't buy it if you can't find it.\\n\", u\"\\nPerhaps you don't know, but it's not just the Guardian that is experiencing declining custom - except The Times, all of them are.\\n\", u\"\\nThe 'liberal' 'left' often get things wrong, because they live in bubbles (usually parts of London and Bristol). What will happen with Brexit and TRump, no one can tell - not me, not you, definitely not the Guardian or its right-on readers. But what we can say for sure is that we've been here before, it's politics, and some people will moan, some will die and others will flourish.\\n\", u'\\nWhat is becoming apparent in the UK is that a significant number of politicians and others do not want to cooperate in the national interest. We might as well erase the word patriotic from our language because it means nothing anymore. There are many times in life when decisions are made that are not the ideal ones but once made you have to make the best out of a bad situation. This is the position now that the UK finds itself in and instead of trying to work together as a government and a nation too many individuals are acting as such. For these people scoring political points seems to be more important than supporting the UK. They appear to revel in criticising and opposing any and every possible solution. This country seems to be in a state where there is less compromise and a rise in intolerance of everything. Back in the day civil war would have erupted.\\n', u'\\n\"If performing \\'theatrics\\' encourages citizens of other EU member states to vote for parties that oppose the sclerotic and thoroughly outdated EU project - and there are, indeed, some very important elections on the continent in 2017 - so much the better.\"\\nThat is not at all a given. A weak point in this guardian view. If May triggers at that time and the pound drops further it may have the opposite effect.\\nWhat\\'s more disturbing is that it would amuse you that the EU falls apart. Why?\\n', u'\\nAn excellent editorial which I guess is another way of saying I agree with most of this and bizarrely, given the somewhat dystopian view, it cheered me up enormously!\\n', u\"\\nDonald and Theresa, build your walls, legislate your anti-immigration procedures, enjoy a State Visit with the Queen and celebrate a hard Brexit. \\nDeliver to those who voted for you the 'proof' of safe measures you promised to make Britain and America great and independent and self sufficient once more. \\nThat will be the perfect time to provoke those who are capable of launching a major terror attack to prove that nothing can prevent them doing this if they really want to...\\n\", u\"\\nDon't you think that tells you something? Nobody buys it anymore.\\n\", u\"\\nThis country has been held hostage by Tory rightwing Euro-sceptics for forty years. They should have been seen off. But their sniping and moaning appear to have won the day. It's not just a disgrace; it's a catastrophe. Imagine it: the Tories as the natural party of government.\\n\", u'\\nNo, he only sacked people for disagreeing with him, and tries to gag certain federal organisations and the media. Nothing sinister at all. In his first WEEK.\\n', u\"\\nHow much they must hate David Cameron. Never mind a pig's head he has literally knobbed the whole country up. It's hard to see how the Tories can get out of it either. They're finished. Let's hope Europe will be magnanimous when we have to go back in.\\n\", u\"\\nThat's OP's point - hurrah! Nevermind the quality, feel the sovereignty!\\n\", u\"\\nThey are so caught up in this newspaper they can't look beyond it.\\n\", u'\\nHe has to - to operate the controls.Picture a vet helping a cow to give birth - a bit like that.\\n', u\"\\nNo, I mean many millions of people voted in a referendum and, regardless of my own view on the matter, I feel it is worth exploring how we can make the best of the situation.\\nIf you want to view it in such a simplistic and childish way then you are of course free to do so and, surely, it is indeed in everyone's best interest to 'sort out their mess', no?\\n\", u\"\\nWell, at least that comment proves you're a bona fide reader of The Guardian.\\n\", u'\\nBritain has taken a massive dump on itself.\\n', u'\\nI voted for Brexit but I think Mrs May made an error getting this close to Trump. He is too unpredictable. We can sign plenty of trade deals without needing to be his puppet. We alreay do plenty of trade with the US, no need for us to appear this desperate.\\n', u'\\nNo idea. How about Putin?\\n', u\"\\n'Global warming is a myth created by the Chinese' \\nClassic case of paranoia to me\\n\", u'\\nMaybe not but they probably would vote UKIP?So election numbers should tell us how many people support it?\\n', u'\\nAll the above is reflective of Guardian readers. Could that be why the Guardian is losing readers.\\n', u'\\nIf Ken Clarke were the leader of either party - any party - I would vote for him. He runs rings around the rest, in intelligence, ability, wit, character, consistency. And I still miss Paddy Ashdown and John Smith.\\nwe need moral leadership and there is none. But Clarke comes close. Strange to think of Clarke as moral leadership but that is what it takes when you are consistent, and not \\'blinded by a Damascene conversion\\' to Brexit. Whaat was it he said? \"I fear that light has been denied me.\" He stands above the mediocrities and chancers, and he will be found to be on the right side of history.\\n', u\"\\nExcept fascists have always dressed up in their opponents' uniforms and performed in front of the cameras. Do you think that's too difficult for Trump's publicists? I'm sure they've already got his indignant speech half written.\\n\", u\"\\nIt's not your failure, it's the brexiter's failure.\\n\", u\"\\nAgreed. It couldn't have been clearer. Leave the EU or remain within it. I didn't see partially leave or partially remain. The majority voted leave - and no amount of hysterical lack of self confidence on a national scale will thwart it.\\n\", u'\\nDoh!\\nA double whammy! Linking to a Daily Mail story and being irrelevant.\\nWell done!\\n', u\"\\n\\nWhere were the protests when Obama was president? \\n\\nHere's one, but there were loads of others:\\nhttp://archives.forusa.org/blogs/nathaniel-mahlberg/month-anti-drone-action-launched-numerous-protests-nationwide/12042\\nCan I help you with anything else or are you happy with your ignorance?\\n\", u\"\\nThe Guardian is battling against almost impossible odds. At our local Waitrose (and I've drawn attention to this matter before, I do wish the Guardian staff would take note), on the newsstand there are usually as many as eight shelf slots allotted to copies of the Daily Fail, with no copies of the Guardian on display. To get our copy we have to grab one at the checkout - if there are any left.\\nAnd Waitrose is hardly a bastion of the far right.\\n\", u\"\\nIt is far too early to judge the success or otherwise of Mrs May's strategy on Brexit. Her cosying up to Trump has been compared by many protestors to Chamerlain's appeasement of Hitler in 1938 yet Chamberlain's diplomacy won us a vital extra year of peace in which to re-arm, without which we would very likely have lost the Battle of Britain in 1940. The approach of the Tories (and now Corbyn's Labour) to pull the rug from under the feet of UKIP thus closing the door on the more extreme populists may yet prove to have been a very smart move, especially compared the established parties in France and Holland if Le Pen and Wilders make significant inroads in the coming elections. Macmillan waned us to play Greece to America's Rome; instead May could play nanny to naughty boy Trump. She already seems to have got him to modify significantly his statements about NATO.\\n\", u'\\nYes, someone is going to start noticing that we already have what used to be called a balance of payments crisis very soon .\\n', u\"\\nYou mean a bunch of clueless, rightwing bigots screw the country and it's up to the rest of us to sort out their mess?\\n\", u\"\\nThere's only one adequate answer to Brexit:\\nOh you want to leave, ok.\\nSee ya.\\nYours truly,500 Million EU citizens.\\nPS: Oh yes, have fun with The Donald and his creepo Goebbels clones (Steve Bannon & Steve Miller).\\n\", u'\\nThen = turn :)\\n', u\"\\n\\nMr Trump cannot now come without London becoming a battleground and the visit a huge embarrassment to the Queen.\\nBattleground? I hope not. Mass turnout? I sincerely hope so! Bring him on! Let us have ordinary, decent, compassionate and\\nnon-violent people thronging the London streets in our millions, telling that despicable monster where to get off!\\nOne thing the Trumpf earnestly hopes, is that there will be violence in the streets during his visit. He thrives on it. Let's prove him wrong.\\n\", u\"\\nThat's absurd. Forget about 'fighting' whatever you mean by that. What we need is trade to fund our NHS, schools, infrastructure, social services, etc. And the best trade we can get is with the markets closest to us, the EU. Therefore the best option is to scrap Brexit asap for all our sakes.\\n\", u\"\\nYou know if the Guardian says it's going to be a disaster that it will then out fine.\\nWrong about the 2015 General Election resultWrong about the EU ReferendumWrong about the US Election result \\nBasically, the Guardian is always getting it wrong, and with an ever dwindling circulation and a website being comprehensively beaten by The Daily Mail for visitors, you know its days are numbered.\\n\", u'\\nAnd he wants to reduce tensions with Russia. Which is a good thing.\\n', u'\\nThe former senior civil servant who organised state visits has argued that this is premature; it is usual to wait for about 3 years into office before issuing such an invitation, as was the case with both Clinton and Obama. So it is not just the howling mob throwing their greasy caps into the air.\\n', u\"\\nWe are sinking into a dystopian nightmare whilst politicians twiddle their thumbs. At some point elective parliamentary democracy has to take back control from the so called 'will of the people' - a fig leaf for charlatans and crypto fascists who actually hate democracy (and so reminiscent of Hitler using referenda aka 'the will of the people' to strip the Reichstag of it's powers in the 1930's). Perish the thought of a second referendum on Brexit - or even the terms of leaving - the 'people' can only be trusted so far. Trump clearly cares not a fig about democratic process now he has clawed his way into power and is acting as if he were Caligula, ostentatiously signing decrees with not a care in the world as to the consequences, in fact rejoicing in them. Democratic process, the values of the Enlightenment themselves are under unprecedented threat across the world from forces and their agents that truly are the 'enemies of the people'.

Not sure how the poor women copes with it all.\\n', u'\\nA sensible and well argued editorial. May has reacted to conditions but without any vision. Trying to outwit Farage while placating her most right-wing MPs and the Daily Mail is a small-minded manoeuvre that ignores the greater realities facing this country. Offering Trump the glorification of a state visit alienates most of Britain\\'s population. It is an almost inconceivable event that will lead to terrible scenes on the streets and global condemnation. For the UK to turn its back on Europe for an \"America first\" trade deal with this fascist is a national suicide attempt.\\n', u'\\nThis has nothing to do with UKIP.4 million people voted UKIP at the last general election.17.4 million people voted Leave in the referendum.So clearly 13.4 million people who want us to leave the EU are not UKIP voters or supporters.30% of Lib Dem voters voted Leave.25% of Green voters.37% of Labour voters.More than half of Tory voters.Half of Plaid voters.36% of SNP voters.Most DUP voters.\\nBefore the referendum you tried to make this into UKIP against the rest of the nation.The vote stats clearly show you were wrong.You are still trying to do it though.\\n', u'\\n\"Britain faces the worst of both worlds\".

This whole system is flexing and stretching to bust at its seams. It's players as so called leaders of all Western Democracies are flagging or radical. No in between. Trump is not alone and not the only actor in his own executive orders. His active advisors and generals and cabinet are, along with Paul Ryan, Michael McConnel et al, and of course VP Pense are causing havoc. Never mind the GOP led panel hearings on Trump's picks to come via the senate votes OK arguably the EU is in threat, and OK PM May is flirting with disaster. But non of this will go sour if the whole thing is stopped and politically reformed to encapsulate rational behaviour across the board. Which should frankly ignore opportunism when it's frankly the danger itself to do otherwise. Israel is annexing and legalising itself as it is emboldened in the Palestinian territories. The right leaning in France and Austria is in motion too for up ticks of their influence. The above mentioned here is too much by far... And there's more. Any political lean to Trump is not a lean to fascism. It's an acknowledgement of the leaning being to curry favour with the big boys, state side. This is not left or right politics. This is advantageous characters aiming for kleptocratic oligarchal despotism in ruling over a corporatised run populace. This is not recognisable to us because its speed and reach and effects are vastly outpacing conscious perception and analysis. This, if it isn't chilled out soon... Is a total wipe out of freedom.  And some people won't even mind watching TV when it ignores the events of oppression all over the globe. Because the facts on TV are now tantamount to instructions for a demographic of actors and voters who know they are right and we are wrong. Nature is a funny thing; look out for a change in your neighbourhood as the streets begin to fill with those who read Trump tweets and comment in his WH Facebook page. They'll be hunting down the foe of the deluded of us, who they are brainwashed onto automatically blaming for their ills... You'd better believe it! It's happening.\\n\", u\"\\nThey keep calling Trump a tyrant but he's threatening to invade no one, unlike so many other presidents and he isn't threatening to lock anyone up, just keep people out. Now you don't have to like his policies but he hardly adds up to a tyrant. \\nKennedy got the US involved in Vietnam, Johnson got it in deeper and between several presidents they killed about 15 million people in south east Asia. That is what I call tyranny, not an immigration ban.\\n\", u'\\nCheers\\n', u'\\nMaggie knew how to get away with it. No sign May does.\\n', u'\\n70 years of peace - sort of, yes. And the predominant thank you for that would go to Nato, not the EU. No, the trading block is not doing well - as highlighted by its stagnant economic growth, high levels of youth unemployment and struggling to land FTAs with many prosperous nations, such as the US.\\n', u'\\nWe are at a crossroads where the disastrous results of giving our power over to a elected representative or political party is a act of irrationality , ignorance, or fear that you could not govern your own existence in this brief time upon this earth. Your life changes everything\\n', u'\\nPart of the argument against brexit was that it would place us in a vulnerable position. Having left the community. Having saddled our exporters with added costs. We are now reliant on whatever friends we can find. Trudeau has the luxury of snubbing the orange racist nonce. Not only do we have to crawl after him, it appears we have to inflict him on Her Brittanic Majesty. \\nOur humiliation is going to be near total and it will be the Brexiteers and their Poundshop Hitler leaders that brought us here. Well done you\"patriots.\"\\n', u\"\\nFair analysis, but still far too forgiving of Theresa May, in assuming her well intentioned, in assuming the logic of her political vision to be tremendously different to that of Trump. In style, they most certainly are as similar as oranges and apples, but both are fruits. An unwillingness among Editorial writers to look into the abyss of where we are going, is natural, but their job is to be brave. Look harder, don't waste your sympathy where it is neither needed nor deserved.\\n\", u\"\\nYou want a state visit to be postponed or abandoned just because a mob of intolerant criminal thugs might run riot in London?\\nWhat an appalling attitude. We should stand up to people who can't demonstrate peacefully, and imprison them for their crimes, not appease them.\\n\", u'\\nStop the trump visit!\\n', u'\\nThe Antarctic is nice this time of year.\\n', u\"\\nThatcher wasn't up to it if you look at the international economic statistics over her period in office. She pissed oil money up against the wall, blew money from asset stripping the nation on tax cuts and didn't improve productivity one fraction of a %. She made people feel richer by making debt cheaper. Basically she turned the nation into a debtor nation and she presided over 11 straight years of structural deficit.\\n\", u'\\nStop the trump visit!!!!!\\n', u'\\nGosh, I feel a little queasy. Can I get off now?\\n', u'\\nWhat a mess. The UK cannot make common cause with the USA. There is no compromise with people like Trump and Farage you are either with them or against them. In 1939 Britain did not know the outcome of of the war with Germany but decided to stand alone. At that time the odds were poor but Nazi values have to be opposed. Today the world is in equal peril the uk must do the same again.\\n', u'\\nThe current Brexit negotiations remind me of a problem.\\nBack in the old days, when schools had no money AT ALL for equipment, many schools relied on a spirit duplicator. The spirit was inflammable.\\nThere was a safety inspection of school carried out regularly. The spirit containers were frequently pointed out as being stored incorrectly. The inspector was VERY good at telling you that wherever the spirit container was, THAT was where it shouldn\\'t be. Many\\'s the time he was asked \"Then where?\" And the answer was always \"Well, not THERE!\" Regardless of how many times it was found a new home, the answer was always the same ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\"\\nI don\\'t think there ever existed a place in any school where it was approved for the bloody stuff to be kept.\\nBrexit is like that. \"We don\\'t want to be in the EU.\" \"So where do you want to be?\" \"Well, ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\" ..... \"Not there!\"\\nTHAT is what I for one find frustrating. There is NO plan. There is not even the inkling of a plan from anyone. Hence Mrs May is now clearly panicking, and looking round for non-existent allies.\\nWe can scrub out the EU 27.RussiaChinaIranIndiaThe USAWe\\'re rapidly getting down to Africa, South America, and a few atolls in the South Pacific as our major trading partners.\\nWhat\\'s that you say? \"Not there?\"\\n', u\"\\nNah, he'll serve his term unless he dies first.

Mrs May thinks she must sacrifice UK economic confidence and national interest in favour of control of borders and migration. \\nActually I think you could have shortened that sentence, to saying that Theresa thinks that she must sacrifice the UKs national interest, in favour of feeling that she is in control. \\nCertainly, after 6 months, the impression is that she is an incredibly weak leader, and her trip to Washington, was simply the result of a need to seek validation, by being pictured holding hands with Donald Trump. As another article suggested today, this may have been triggered by jealousy of the relationship that Farage was able to boast about with Trump.\\nDuring the leadership non-contest, the Conservatives famously had an article pulled from the Telegraph, because it was seen as so damaging to her prospects. This characterised her as the \"Cersei Lannister\" of British politics whose autocratic tendencies masked deep insecurities. This accuracy of this characterisation, is only becoming more apparent, with each day we come closer to Brexit.\\n', u\"\\n\\nBut his presidency is changing the already severe risks from Brexit into something potentially disastrous for Britain.\\n\\nWith all due respect, you didn't even think Leave would win the Referendum, nor think Trump would win the election.

Mrs May says she wants the European Union to succeed; Mr Trump gives every indication of actively seeking the EU\\u2019s collapse. Mrs May supports the Iran nuclear deal; Mr Trump aims to withdraw from it. Mrs May is firm about sanctions against Russian aggression in Crimea. Mr Trump hints constantly that he wants the sanctions lifted.\\n\\nIt isn't going to matter what Mrs May wants. She is bailing out of a Union in which the UK had a large say into a m\\xe9nage \\xe0 deux  with a rampant power in which it will have no say.\\n\", u\"\\nWhy all this nonsense about the Queen's embarrassment?

May needs to change tack very quickly, on both this and her Brexit stance. They're looking more ugly with each passing day.\\n\", u\"\\nWell, May thinks she will be able to influence Trump, then she is deluded. In Trump's eyes, May represents clear access to cash. He will chew her up and then spit her remains on burning embers. She is a fool and he is evil.\\n\", u'\\nTrump will be gone in 4 years (or probably less), almost certainly before the UK has actually left the EU. The next US president will not look upon those who facilitated Trump favourably.\\n', u'\\nLeave campaign: \"we\\'ll stay in the single market\"Brexit implementation: \"we\\'ll leave the single market\"Guts and Glory but ... no Brains?\\n', u'\\nHmmm....unmitigated followed by mitigating.

ministers run the risk of hubris, the Downing Street historian Anthony Seldon observed <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"

Tuesday. David Cameron\\u2019s fall is the most recent illustration of that. Mr Cameron thought he could win a referendum on the European Union and marginalise Ukip. He failed, with disastrous consequences for Britain. Theresa May is the beneficiary. But Mrs May is now running the same risk, of thinking that she can hold on to power and popularity by tacking to the right and trying to squeeze the air out of Ukip.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Mrs May\\u2019s policy on Brexit is at the heart of this recklessness. Mrs May thinks she must sacrifice UK economic confidence and national interest in favour of control of borders and migration. This is wrong enough in itself, as Kenneth Clarke pointed out in his formidable contribution to Tuesday\\u2019s <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/31/article-50-debate-brexit-government-lying-about-how-easy-brexit-will-be-says-owen-smith-politics-live?page=with:block-58909076e4b0b3e971af51d0#block-58909076e4b0b3e971af51d0\" title=\"\"> Commons debate</a>. This is also why opposition MPs should join him to oppose Mrs May\\u2019s bill to trigger the UK\\u2019s departure from the EU.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But this foolish choice of priorities also pushes the May government into the premature embrace of a trade deal with the United States, which now means with Donald Trump. Brexit activists welcomed Mr Trump\\u2019s win. But his presidency is changing the already severe risks from Brexit into something potentially <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fde7616a-e6cf-11e6-967b-c88452263daf\" title=\"\">disastrous for Britain</a>.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Mrs May heads a government that is committed to free trade; Mr Trump is the most protectionist president of modern times. Mrs May supports the United Nations and Nato; Mr Trump is equivocal, at best, about both. Mrs May says she wants the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a> to succeed; Mr Trump gives every indication of actively seeking the EU\\u2019s collapse. Mrs May supports the Iran nuclear deal; Mr Trump aims to withdraw from it. Mrs May is firm about sanctions against Russian aggression in Crimea. Mr Trump hints constantly that he wants the sanctions lifted.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Mrs May did not spot the dangers of all this clearly enough at first. Instead she was goaded by Nigel Farage\\u2019s early access to Mr Trump, and by the suggestion that the former Ukip leader might be a suitable UK ambassador to the US, to try to push Mr Farage to the margins. Doing down Mr Farage weighed more heavily than advancing the UK\\xa0national interest. So she did something he\\xa0could not, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/31/how-nigel-farages-taunts-prompted-hasty-offer-of-trump-state-visit\" title=\"\">prematurely offering Mr Trump a state visit</a> to the UK, with all the access to the Queen and the accompanying pageantry that the US president could want.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>This offer may have seemed smart when it was decided within a couple of weeks of Mr\\xa0Trump\\u2019s election. But it has now proved to\\xa0be a disaster two weeks after he took office. The practical problem for Mrs May is stark. Mr Trump cannot now come without London becoming a battleground and the visit a huge embarrassment to the Queen. Somehow or other, it must be postponed or abandoned.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>That\\u2019s because moderate as well as radical opinion in the US and Britain has been scandalised by the sheer nastiness of Mr Trump\\u2019s early moves. Even the Brexiters have now gone quiet about him. The most dangerous global effect of Mr Trump\\u2019s acts is to be a recruiting sergeant for radical Islamists. That\\u2019s difficult enough for Mrs May. But her hope of promoting her <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> policy by posing as a firm and practical ally of Mr Trump now isn\\u2019t working in middle Britain either. It may even provide the missing ingredient that the SNP is constantly searching for to prise Scotland out of the UK.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Mrs May\\u2019s Brexit strategy is in crisis. The approach was already bad enough \\u2013 pushing ahead with Brexit too fast, hardening the terms, threatening a tax and tariff war with the EU if she doesn\\u2019t get the deal she wants. All of this was shaped by the old Tory instinct for playing to the Eurosceptic gallery. But\\xa0now it is worse still. She is aiming for a theatrical snub of the EU <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/may-will-trigger-brexit-on-march-9-7tnnndgw0\" title=\"\">by triggering article 50 at a summit on 9 March</a>, just six days before the Dutch general election, thereby actively helping the anti-EU and anti-migrant Freedom party of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders\" title=\"\">Geert Wilders</a>.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Even this, though, could be as nothing compared with the perception in Europe that Mrs May\\u2019s Britain is happy to work to undermine and even destroy the EU in alliance with Mr Trump. That is becoming a real possibility. It is an outcome that even Mrs\\xa0May must want to prevent. It would mean the UK getting not the best of both worlds in its relationship with Europe and the US, but the worst. A collapse of relations with Europe alongside an \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d trade deal with the US is a nightmare scenario. But Mrs May\\u2019s policies have made it a real possibility.

      "comment_text [u'\\n\"the Sanders left and its allies are the only force in the US that have the ideas that can win an immediate majority in this country\"\\nYes indeed, and yes, if the establishment Democrats do not recognize their obsequesious incompetences and conflicts of interest they must be swept from both floors.No doubt that distractionary skirmishes around the periphery will need to be fought early on but the ultimate focus must be on reinvigoration of the GOP and standing against corruption in government.It is the only way to upset the governmentally endorsed corporate takeover of our communities and minds.\\n', u'\\nTime to change tactics my leftie friends. You tried trashing Trump for a year and it did not work.\\nIn fact one can make the case you all took a guy at 3% chance of winning to a full win.\\nCongratulation to the Guardian for doing that work for us.\\nI guess I will now have to support you.\\n', u'\\nThe term \"working class,\" has loose ends.Are folks who never worked and never will, properly characterized as working class? And as well, some blue collar workers make handsome money, and regard themselves as middle class.\\n', u\"\\nYes the world is against you if you are a liberal and just doesn't understand......For all the catwailing, we are witnessing the demise of this current social justice form of liberalism. It allowed itself to be distorted by digital and it has been reduced to a 'phenomena of 'likes' and 'dislikes' (Trump is a big troll so lets march). \\nLiberalisms biggest advocates are the not-so-transparent tech companies and trans-national NGOS. Not people. Voters are fast becoming the enemy, they sneered at and taunted as uneducated and their opinions and personal expwriences unwarranted. This hysteria is the last scream. By the end of 2017, the millennials will be bored (bored by getting angry on twitter) and have moved onto another cause (what happened to developing world poverty debt relief?) whilst some will grow up and realise just how tough the world is.\\n\", u\"\\nAw, lighten up. You're overwrought.\\n\", u\"\\nMaybe they could dig up and prop up their hero Fidel? Although Danny Ortega is still around. How about him? Raul? Evo Morales? Kim Jung Un? Too late for Pol Pot, Mao, Ho or Stalin I think. There just aren't many Communist dictators around any more to chose from.\\n\", u\"\\nIf the Democrats want to put a crimp in Donald Trump's style that had better start promoting -electable Democrats. The less like Hillary, the better. Have the Democrat power elite ever really understood why the young folks were enthusiastic for Bernie Sanders? I doubt it. \\nThey had better understand the dynamic or they will keep on losing.\\n\", u'\\nOur elections do not reflect the will of the people. This has been the case, to some degree, from our founding. Money talks; it also votes, and its votes are always counted.\\nThere were a number of well-publicized ethical and potentially illegal actions by both the DNC and on the part of Republicans. \\nI think there is ample evidence that the DNC, with the help of the media, sought delegitimize and suppress coverage of the Sanders campaign. The media also gave Trump billions of dollars worth of free air time. Greg Palast is an investigative reporter who has written a lot about the electile dysfunction that has given us a dictatorial authoritarian.\\nYou may read this and still disagree with me, of course. btw -- What or whom are you rebelling against? \\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-gops-stealth-war-against-voters-w435890\\n', u'\\nDemocrats still undefeated against strawmen! !\\n', u'\\nBERNIE OR BUST It is the fault of the DNC that we now have a fascist like Trump in the White House. \\nHILLARY SUPPORTERHow so?\\nBERNIE OR BUSTIf the DNC hadn\\u2019t stolen the nomination from Bernie, he could have have beaten Trump.\\nHILLARY SUPPORTERExplain how the nomination was stolen from him? Hillary won the popular vote by over 3 million votes. That\\u2019s a pretty wide margin. There was no evidence that voting booths were rigged. \\nBERNIE OR BUSTFace it. She was an awful nominee. Young people weren\\u2019t inspired by her. She didn\\u2019t connect with millennials voters. They didn\\u2019t want her. \\nHILLARY SUPPORTERBut nor was the Black community inspired by Bernie. Hillary won 75 percent of the Black vote and 60 percent of the Latino vote. So by your logic, Bernie was an awful candidate too. \\nBERNIE OR BUSTThat\\u2019s different. Minorities didn\\u2019t know Bernie. They were only voting for Hillary based on name recognition. \\nHILLARY SUPPORTERSo you are saying that people of color vote according to name recognition but whites vote based on the issues? That\\u2019s a racist assumption coming for a progressive. \\nBERNIE OR BUSTYou are twisting my words. And anyway, the Clintons don\\u2019t care about people of color. They are responsible for the mass incarceration of minorities in the 1990s. \\nHILLARY SUPPORTERBut Bernie voted in favor of mass incarceration too. \\nBERNIE OR BUSTThat was different!!!\\nHILLARY SUPPORTERWhy?\\nBERNIE OR BUSTYou are just a tool of the corrupt capitalist system.\\nHILLARY SUPPORTERUm\\u2026that is not an answer to the question.\\n', u'\\n\"We have been researching and discussing a strategy for resistance\"\\nSo you are clearly against a democratic process and the will-of-the-people. You didn\\'t get a result you wanted-in SPITE of collusion and corruption by your anointed one-and still lost an election via procedures in place prior to 1800.\\n', u'\\n\"If the vote of the people actually mattered\"\\nIf honesty and openness mattered it would have been Bernie running against Trump.\\n', u'\\nThe anti-Trump movement has already failed. What we are seeing now are death-throes.\\n', u'\\nIt feels as though this administration is waging war upon its own country. Women, immigrants, African Americans, immigrants, Hispanic Americans, the poor, the disabled, and the working class. I have never before seen so much hate joined with such arrogant incompetence.\\nMy family and I have been protesting twice or more a week, and persistently calling our elected officials as these appointments are considered. The Congressional Democrats, most of them corporate-owned, are doing what they always do -- protecting their own donors and therefore, themselves, venal and spineless to the end.\\nWe have been researching and discussing a strategy for resistance. Unlike some, I believe peaceful, persistent, protest is necessary. Trump watches TV incessantly and I\\'ve no doubt this opposition is very upsetting to him. By our protests and legal challenges, we have put him \"on notice\", and unlike his nebulous threats against Iran we know exactly what that means.\\n', u\"\\nThe only ideological purity the Left needed was a candidate that wasn't polling negatively with the majority of the population before the campaign even started.\\n\", u\"\\nRoll Bernie Sanders up and smoke him. He isn't the point. \\nDon't you realize that a hypothetical generic Democrat candidate would have beaten Trump? \\nAnd yet Hillary Clinton did not. Because the public did not now, and never has, wanted Hillary Clinton for their president. \\nThe DNC ran their preferred candidate instead of the Left/middle public's wishes. It blew up in their face. \\nCould the public have prevented that problem by coming out in force just a little more? Yes. And the public might have done exactly that, if the mainstream media had not been so far up HRC's ass that they weren't even honestly reporting how close the race was. \\nYou can run the rationalizing in circles around all day long. But the blame is always in the same place when the music stops.\\n\", u\"\\nI keep hearing this. I'm going to continue what I've been doing for twenty years now -- protesting and writing against human rights violations. I've done it because it is my moral obligation as a citizen and human being. It has cost me rather than paid me. I would not take money for standing up for human rights, because, as I said, it is a matter of conscience and compassion.\\n\", u'\\nlol what are you talking about? If the vote of the people actually mattered, than Clinton would be president now. And I am not even speaking about the manipulated voting machines.\\n', u\"\\nShhhh....it's supposed to be a secret. But just between you and me - with my payoff for protesting I was able to buy two pairs of jimmy choos.\\n\", u'\\nAnti trump \"resistence\". Listen to yourselves. The neo cons are so used to having their way with America they are not holding back, seeking to sow a scorched earth policy with American society rather than yield one inch to a populist they dont control. \\nThe media is their primary tool of control. Its a weapon neo cons use to attack anyone who threatens their reign and whip up chaos and violence targeting those they dont control. Its so fun watching Steve Bannon troll them.\\n', u\"\\nThe only way the Democratic Party will survive is for the DNC to divest from it's Clinton Legacy and return to FDR Populism and relate to core middle-class and poor voters. The current Corporate Democratic Party's political posturing as Republican-Lite resulted in Hillary's failed campaign. The DNC's choosing Hillary over Bernie was a colossal failure.\\n\", u'\\nYou are confusing \"getting elected\" with \"getting the job done.\"\\n', u'\\nThe \"soul\" of the democratic party has always been inclusiveness, not ideological purity. Those who call for a progressive revolution within the democratic party are enabling GOP to win. Learn from history, because history repeats itself.\\n', u'\\n\"No more centrism\" will guarantee republican victory. Compromise and centrism are what have always given us democrat victory.\\n', u'\\nMost democrat voters are what you call \"republican right.\" The suggestion that the majority of democrats \"must go\" is going to assure republican governance. When democrats embrace diversity of opinion, they are elected to government-- that\\'s pragmatism at work, not \"republican light\" as you call it.\\n', u'\\nThe fect that Clinton didn\\'t win big proves the left screwed up by struggling over ideological purity. The left was divided and conquered by a mad man-- \"so sad.\"\\n', u'\\nA progressive party would guaranty the hegemony of the far right for generations; it\\'s exactly what the right wing wants (and is getting)-- divide and conquer.

I suspect it will take Progressives to get rid of the current crop of corporate elites today - as well. To that end, bravo Sunkara and thousands of other progressives for their fresh ideas. I will now add mine.\\nTake a tip for old Tipp O-Neil - all politics are local. Start at the local level, in your own town or city by attending meeting of your own city councils, boards of supervisors and school boards and...\\nAsk the same question, until you get straight answers. What you want to know is how much tax money your elected officials are giving to corporations and conservative organizations in your city. Be careful because local politicians speak in code and you need to break the code. \\nFor example, \"Economic Development\" and \"Job Creation\" is code for \"Corporate Welfare\" - and - the bigger the corporation, the bigger the give-away. \\nAnother example... \"Consultant\" is code for elected officials giving tax money to corporations without public knowledge. \\nThere are state and local roadblocks to break through as well. For example, for several decades now, the California Brown Act has been protecting elected officials, not the public. Elected officials adjourn to \"Closed Session\" so they can discuss corporate interests, not public interests. I\\'ve been in those closed-session meetings, so I know what is discussed as well as the effing law that prevents any elected official from repeating it in public. \\nYou need to educate your school board members on budgets. Sorry folks, but your school district budget is designed to prevent anyone from understanding any of it. In this way, Public School District Superintendents maintain complete control of one of the largest allocations of tax dollars in your city. Tax money circulates in and out of school districts for corporate welfare programs including job training, real estate, housing developments and new construction projects. Do you really need a school in the middle of a farm -20 miles from family homes? No. Those new schools are Corporate Welfare for real estate developers who will buy cheap land near the new school and make a bigger profit from the sale of new homes.\\nDemand your elected officials require developers to publicly disclose their profit margin on housing projects in your city. When we did this we discovered one developer building the same housing development ten miles outside city limits increased their profit from $10,000.oo to $90,000.oo for each house.

I don't claim to have a privileged point of view. But I think we should be cautious about our assumptions. Bernie was untainted because the noise machine didn't turn against him. Had he won the primary, he'd have been less vulnerable than Clinton on a range of things, but more vulnerable to (preposterous) charges of being a left-wing extremist who'd take away everyone's American economic freedoms. He didn't have to deal with the weight of lies, smears and hysteria that would have come his way. Both fiscal and religious conservatives would have had trouble voting for him. \\nAnd let's not forget that Bloomberg announced he would run as an independent if Sanders got the nomination. \\nI'd like to be clear that I'd have liked Sanders to win the primaries. Him as president would have been as positive a change as Trump's victory is terrible. I just think it's dangerous if we neglect to question 'if only Sanders had been the nominee' assumptions and anything that might turn out to have an element of wishful thinking inside it. And it's even more dangerous if we proceed in these dangerous times thinking of Clinton and the faction she represents as a bigger problem than Trump and the movement he leads.\\n\", u\"\\nI have not forgotten.

This site was created by women who had been vilified by Berniebros during the primary and so created a safe space to discuss their political beliefs without sexist, misogynistic attacks. What the leftist purists get wrong is the fact that the Democratic party is not a monolith. Do you really think that pulling the party as far to the left as possible will get a large enough plurality of supporters from all over the US, including young urban dwellers, suburban families and voters from more rural areas? I don\\'t see how this author can think that the Tea Party has been successful. The dysfunction that is now going on in Washington is not what I would characterize as successful. When you say that the \"left and its allies are the ONLY force in the US that have the ideas that can win an immediate majority on this country\", you sound just like Trump when he said at the Republican National Convention \"I alone can fix this\". That is an arrogant, unsubstantiated statement that turns off a great many people. \\nThe \"old Democratic establishment\" are the people that fought for civil rights, for women to have rights over their own bodies, for LGBTQ rights, for immigration rights, for refugees to have a safe haven in our country. The leftist purists with their protest votes just put all of that at risk. As an \"old Dem\" who\\'s primary candidate didn\\'t always win, I still voted for the Democrat in order to preserve these rights for others. The tantrum-throwing. privileged Berners just threw all the work we\\'ve done for years out the window and put millions of innocent peace-loving people around the world at risk. People who finally got healthcare, who have pre-existing conditions and can now get insurance, whose children can stay on their plan until the age of 26; millions of people are now at risk of being denied care. Why on earth would anyone put their total trust in a group that wanted to blow everything up because they didn\\'t get their way? Contrary to what the author stated, the people did not subordinate all other political priorities to fight enemy No. 1. If they had, they would\\'ve voted for Hillary and we wouldn\\'t be in the mess we\\'re in. You didn\\'t resist Trump when you had the chance, so what makes you think that now \"the Sanders left and its allies are the only force in the US that have the ideas that can win an immediate majority in this country\"? You blew the chance we had at having progressive rule in charge of our country. Contrary to what this author thinks, Hillary voters are for class-based jobs, justice and so much more. Bernie supporters were fooled into thinking that the \"Democratic establishment\" was the enemy instead of the realizing the very real threat was Trump and his white nationalist followers. He let us know this on a daily basis every day for 18 months. He talked about taking away people\\'s rights constantly. Why on earth should we let people who were not astute enough to vote against this destructive, racist, xenophobic, misogynistic idiot of a man to now know what\\'s best for the Democratic party and be in charge?\\nWe ALL need to work together, recognizing that we are not going to agree on everything, but that the basic tenet of the Democratic party is for basic human rights for everyone. That we do not believe in religious or racial discrimination, that women have the right to make their own decisions about their own bodies. If we stay divided we will keep losing. One of the biggest reasons the GOP has been gaining so much ground over the last few years has been because of gerrymandering. It is VERY important that we win back seats in the midterms because the census is coming up and with it comes the redrawing of district lines. The one thing the GOP does right is that even if they don\\'t like their chosen candidate, they come together and vote in order to have power. I find it funny that so many young people are arguing that they need to be the ones that take over the Dem party when that is the group that votes the least in the midterms. Had they come out in higher numbers, we wouldn\\'t have GOP rule in the House and Senate. We need to come together and work together in spite of our differences if we are to hold onto progressive values. Too many people are being hurt by the election of Donald Trump and we need to vow to never elect such a monster ever again. That should be the common goal here. We criticize the right for not being inclusive and accepting of others. We need to practice the acceptance we preach by embracing Democrats across the spectrum; by listening to each other, having a deep understanding of the issues and realizing that we\\'re not always going to agree on everything all the time. That is the only way we can save this sinking ship.\\n', u'\\nIt is pretty readable Mr. Darkness. You have teaparty mentality. Is that clear? Trump thanks you for your support.\\n', u'\\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\\n', u'\\nThe Democratic left is self-distrctive. They destroyed their collation and became a left of center party incapable of winning a majority of races around the country. Now the best they can do, is walk out on hearings or cry on TV over 109 immigrants. Expand your base. If it takes kicking out a lot of old, stuffy, established politicians.. kick them out!!!!!!\\n', u'\\nLong_Shanks,\\nExactly so. IF the Democrats don\\'t purge the Party of the so-called \"Progressives\", who HATE those of us who are of the trade unions, who reside outside the largest of cities & those who see themselves to be \"completely superior in every way to\" the working class, the working poor & the truly poor, the Party is FINISHED.(The truly committed Progressives comprise no more than 25% of adult voters & a quarter of the electorate is a losing percent in almost any \"2 candidate\" US election.)\\nThe simple facts are:1. The Party establishment \"fixed\" the primaries, so that Senator Sanders could not win.2. The Party bosses selected the wrong candidate for President & who then ran the most incompetent campaign in a generation.3. The Obama administration lost several States because of their FOOLISH \"War on Coal\" & on the petroleum industry, which put many rank & file union members (& many non-union members, too) out of their good-paying jobs.(In 2017, no industrial nation can operate solely on \"renewable energy\" sources, regardless of the utter nonsense spewed out by the \"radical environmentalists\".)and4. IF the Democratic Party is foolish enough to repeat 2016\\'s sad & feckless performance, expect to lose 8-10 more US Senate seats in those States that \"went for Trump\" in 2018 & the General Election for POTUS in 2020..\\n', u\"\\n\\nNothing's free, Buster\\n\\nI didn't use the word free, you did. I am not a socialist, I'm a commonwealth libertarian who understands that the state serves the people better when it administers those areas in which private industry forms natural monopolies: healthcare, public transportation, national parks and the environment come to mind.\\nIn the US our cartel system of healthcare costs an average eight times more than the state run NHS of Britain with generally better outcomes in significant areas (infant mortality for instance). Obamacare was simply another way to place tax funds under the private administration of for-profit health insurance companies - it was a system. I'm curious are you opposed to the Veteran\\u2019s Administration which provides free-at-point-of-use health care to our military?\\n\", u'\\nHmmm. \"I want a nationalized healthcare system, state-funded education for all, an expanded public transportation system,\"------\\nNothing\\'s free, Buster! And who\\'s gonna pay for the \"free stuff\" you talk about---nationalized healthcare system, state funded education for all? We have already experienced the disaster that is Obamacare. I don\\'t want my healthcare placed in the hands of \"the state\". The State could then decide who gets health care, how much and under which circumstances. I\\'ve already lived under communism and don\\'t want socialism. The taxpayers would pay for the free stuff. You socialists----I mean communists---just don\\'t get it. I\\'m also \"naturalized\". I don\\'t know where you came from, but most of us in the US don\\'t want socialism.\\n', u'\\nI agree with your post except for two points:1. It may be just the structure of the sentence, but It is otherwise scary to believe you think unemployed, left-behind blue collar workers are spoiled.2. Clinging to the notion that about half the voters were motivated by racism and sexism will do nothing to win back the former core of the party that has been excluded by the party of inclusion in recent years. The notion may be gratifying in reinforcing a feeling of moral superiority, but that\\'s about it. Continuing to call folks who may disagree, even somewhat, with even parts of the Democratic agenda, racist, sexist, deplorable, clinging to guns and religion, etc., etc. is unlikely to encourage them to return to the fold. On that score, I fear many in the party still don\\'t \"get\" what happened in 2016.\\n', u'\\nFalse. Hillary was such a seriously flawed candidate that she should have stepped aside and supported Bernie. The Party hacks lined up at the trough for her expecting all the rewards that would go with it (access and power) but they were wrong. I was so sick of hearing \"But Bernie can;t win\". Well Hillary could not win. I have worked for Democrats in Congress, in my State House, been a delegate to conventions and held my nose and voted for Hilary because Trump was such a disaster. I bet none of you \"old establishment Democrats\" would have done the same if Bernie had won. But that would not have mattered because the atypical voter is what made the difference in this election. You \"old establishment Democrats\" could not even get out the vote FFS\\n', u'\\nI consider democrats who stayed home and those who voted third party to be one and the same. They essentially did the same thing.\\n', u\"\\nThe author's credential notwithstanding I happen to agree with the assertion. Pelosi and Schumer need to be out of the leadership positions that they hold. Period.\\n\", u'\\nI agree with your comments completely as the numbers speak for themselves. Had Bernie dropped out in March when it was mathematically impossible for him to win and got behind Hillary instead of continuing to paint her & the Democratic party as evil, we would not be in the mess we are now. Sanders lost the primary by 3.7 million votes. It wasn\\'t even close. If a fraction of the amounts of third party voters or protest voters had instead voted for Hillary, she would be president and we wouldn\\'t be seeing so many people afraid for their lives not just in this country, but around the world. I just read a story of an infant Iranian girl who was scheduled to have urgent heart surgery, had jumped through all the necessary hoops to get here, and was not allowed into the country on Saturday. They have no idea what their next move is or what will happen to their precious baby. We \"old establishment Democrats\" have been around long enough to understand the consequences of voting for a Republican (or protest voting). It\\'s not like we always agree with everything Democrats do. That\\'s ridiculous to think so. But it\\'s much easier to get progressive ideals implemented with a Democrat in office. Where I disagree with you is that I feel we do have plenty of reason to panic. Trump and Bannon are a dangerous threat to US and the rest of the world. It may take a long time to recover. And I fear that my children and grandchildren are going to grow up in a very different America than we did.\\n', u\"\\nDuring the primaries it was clear that Hillary was going to lose or run a very tight race against Trump according to national polls. But what did the DNC elites do? They doubled down on Hillary despite Bernie having a commanding lead over Trump among Independents who were closed out of the primaries process. The DNC happily rigged the election against Bernie and got burned. Now they're trying to blame everyone else but themselves for their massive F' up.\\n\", u\"\\nFocus. There are 30 million legal residents in US who are not allowed to vote. But in many states they are automatically registered - motor-voter laws. They have to proactively say that they are not citizens.\\nWe don't know how many of the 30 million legal residents (green card holders) are registered and how many voted. But as the system is today, there is nothing preventing them. Trump says compare the electoral rolls with the citizenship rolls and we will see how big a problem this is.\\nI think that assuming that 10-20% of legal residents (3-6 million people) could vote - by mistake or intentionally - is not such a crazy idea. Lot of legal resident non-citizens don't know the rules. In states where they get automatically registered (California, NY, ...) they could vote. Let's find out by comparing the two lists: voters to citizens. Why are you afraid of doing it? By the way, there is really no other way to know for sure. It is an honor system. So not having too many people confessing that they did it means very little.\\n\", u\"\\nOf course it is -- as a conservative Republican -- but don't hold your breath. True Democrats are too smart to do what this Republican troll of a writer is suggesting. We would love to give YOU the Bernie bots. They belong in the Trumpster crowd.\\n\", u'\\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/444393/koch-brothers-winter-meeting-cautious-optimism-future-battleshttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/21/americas-oligarchy-not-democracy-or-republic-unive/Which produces such gems asRight to work - bust up those unions for freeloader poverty wages.Charter schools - \"privatize\"/profitize public spending.Diminish workers compensation - already kicked off in Texas.\"pushing against Renewable Portfolio Standards\" - moving energy spending into their oil sales.etc.\\n', u'\\nLove how the racism, sexism, and xenophobia Trump tapped into is dressed up as \"anger and frustration.\" Well, even though those folks didn\\'t realize what they were doing to themselves when they voted for Trump, eventually it will sink in with them that they made a mistake. Trump doesn\\'t care about them any more than he cared about all the middle class folks he\\'s stolen money from or refused to pay. He\\'s not smart enough to hide his true colors for very long. \"Wrong candidates?\" Did you see the array of fools that ran for the Republican primary? The difference is that Republicans got behind their nominee, whether he was their first choice or not -- much like Hillary\\'s supporters did in \\'08. But, the Bernie folks did not and that\\'s how we lost the Electoral College. (paper thin margins in rust belt states). That\\'s NO reason to panic. We\\'ll be back stronger than ever to clean up the Republican mess. Like we have throughout modern history.\\n', u\"\\nPlease post this writer's credentials that allow him to use the first person plural in discussing the Democratic Party. I ask because he's suggesting a prescription for disaster, total BS. A plan spawned by the need for immediate gratification at the first sign of trouble. We're a Party who lived through Nixon, Reagan, and Bushes I and II and each time came back stronger than ever. This time we had a candidate who garnered the 2nd most popular votes in history (next to President Obama) and lost because some spoiled Bernie Bots and blue collar workers -- by a paper thin margin -- couldn't support the Party's candidate like Hillary's supporters did when she lost in '08. These people have NO loyalty to anyone but themselves as evidenced by the fact that many of them voted for Trump. Mature, lifelong Democrats know that sometimes we lose elections. Bernie bots need to learn that, too. This loss was the closest in history and mostly generated by racism and sexism (some of it on the part of Bernie supporters). That doesn't mean we abandon our strong tradition of defending the vulnerable and turn the Party over to a bunch of spoiled children who can't accept reality. There are enough intelligent, educated, longstanding and loyal Democrats who will assure that won't happen. Trump is temporary -- probably less than 4 years. We'll be back defending our long-held principles and, as before, stronger than ever.\\n\", u'\\nI figured that out pretty quickly. Would love to know where he gets off using the first person plural to talk about MY party, then suggest we abandon our Party principles and turn it over to a bunch of whiny Bernie bots and spoiled blue collar workers. Unlike HIllary supporters in \\'08, those folks couldn\\'t bring themselves to support the Party\\'s nominee -- even though she was clearly the most qualified, most prepared, and most admired woman in the world. (I do believe the operative word here is \"woman.\") As a result, they gave us Trump. I\\'ll die before I\\'ll let those fools take over our Party.\\n', u\"\\nWhat a shame that you couldn't support Hillary who was clearly the most qualified candidate (why she won the primary) and would have had us going in the right direction. Instead, because people like you couldn't support the Democratic primary winner (like HIllary did in '08), we have Trump. What an awful example you've set for your daughter. My MBA daughter and her equally educated friends, chose to vote for the realist candidate who didn't try to win votes by offering pie-in-the-sky. You may want Medicare-for-all, but you should wise up and examine the candidates more carefully. The truly qualified candidate was honest with you about how and when that could be achieved. Bernie wasn't.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump promised 10 million new jobs in his first year. That's 833,000 jobs per month (rounded down).\\nI live in a state that does offer many if any coal or manufacturing jobs. What is he bringing back for my family?\\nWill everything done by Executive Order? That was the chief complaint about the Kenyan Muslim that just left office.\\nJust deplorable!\\n\", u'\\nWhere do I behin - it was one country - in a DIRECT response to a specific threat that a couple recent refugees from there found in America had plans to carry out an attack. It wasnt a \"muslim ban\" - nice try though. \\nIt didnt affect current green card holders - again - was ONE country - wasnt announced in remotely the same way, wasnt implemented in such a quick hot mess with no real instruction or clarity or leadership like last weekend.And maybe....just maybe - much more of our country supported our president than do now. \\nIt was quite different in a number of ways.\\n', u'\\n\\n\"Free Tuition for All!!! No Student Debt!!!\"\\n\\nAfter the double espresso wears off you may wish to consider that the first free public institution of higher education was founded in the United States, the Free Academy of the City of New York. Additionally, many of the United States\\' European competitors have free at-point-of-use university education. The \"Berniecrats\" (you lot and name calling - it\\'s pathetic, it really is) didn\\'t vote for Clinton because she failed to make a persuasive argument for much needed change in Washington politicking. Trump is a symptom of your worn out, cynical ethic and complacent attitude towards the drudgery and hopelessness of millions of your fellow Americans.\\n', u\"\\nSO sick of having to explain this to you dense Trumpsters. There is NO comparison between Obama's banning of Iraquis (ONE country) because of FBI INTEL on some folks who slipped through who had launched IEDs in Iraq. Those folks were apprehended in Kentucky and the vetting process was reviewed in that 6-month period. No need for demonstrations. Trump issued a broad ban based on no specific threat that harmed thousands of green card holders and people in the middle of the vetting process. And, his order has NO credibility because it omitted Saudi Arabia -- which spawned the 9/11 terrorists. Why? Take a guess. Trump has business interests there. He puts his business interests in front of our safety.\\n\", u'\\n\"ditch establishment Democrats.\"... Why don\\'t we start with shithead Schumer, Senate Minority Leader. This arse was parading up and down the women\\'s march in New York City, promising to \"fix this.\" So far, he\\'s voted in favor of every Trump secretarial appointee, except Elaine Cho for Transportation Secretary.\\n', u'\\nLike \"Briteracan\" notes, When Obama was elected, those of us who weren\\'t overjoyed at his election did not stage massive protests. We us may have grumbled a bit and expressed disappointment to friends and neighbors, but for God\\'s sake, we didn\\'t parade around and act like blooming idiots. It seems the Communist liberal left isn\\'t happy unless it\\'s raising hell, protesting this, that or the other and breaking things along the way. I have wondered what screaming, yelling, waving signs, holding up traffic and breaking things are supposed to prove or accomplish. It won\\'t change the election results. Such childish and antisocial behavior does not serve to better the country. I have come to believe that the left cares only about big government, power, imposing its will on others and about the numerous hysterias the left cooks up to get everything and everyone stirred up. Classic hysterias are \"global warming\", \"everyone\\'s racist, homophobic, xenophobic or islamophobic etc. Leftists will never grow up, though. That\\'s too much to expect.\\n', u'\\nSo, instead you so-called \"true liberals\" have done nothing but pout because you didn\\'t get immediate gratification in the primary and now we have a mentally unstable President and a cabinet that includes SIX, count\\'em SIX Goldman-Sachs people. How\\'s that for a Wall Street darling? You are NOT true liberals. If you really cared about liberal principles you would have supported Hillary Clinton, like Clinton supporters backed President Obama in \\'O8. Instead, you threw tantrums and, as a result, we have Trump. You wouldn\\'t know a liberal if she knocked you over. \\nPeople who successfully marched to end the Vietnam War and for Civil and Women\\'s rights are TRUE liberals.

Basically, she was wealthy, secretive, completely without sincerity, and lacking any kind of direction or principles.A centrist to me implies the willingness to balance conflicting needs. The fringes never even admit there are conflicting needs.\\n\", u'\\nCurrently, many of the moderate Democrats *were* Republicans. There\\'s no place for them in the current Tea Party/Bannon party no they know it. That migration has been going on for a long time, possibly since Bill Clinton\\'s centrism jerked the Democrats hard rightward. Since the \\'90\\'s the Democratic Party has come more and more to resemble Eisenhower Republicanism, allowing the actual Republicans to tack further and further right until they were basically taken over by the John Birch Society. Your idea would be a good one if we didn\\'t also have to deal with nationwide gerrymandering and the willingness of the right to \"primary\" any candidate not ideologically pure enough (i.e., capable of governing). Because of the primary system, the most politically engaged choose the candidate that will represent the party. On the Republican side, since 2008 that has been the tinfoil hat brigade. There is zero indication that \\'moderate Republicans,\\' whoever and wherever they are, can or even want to fight back.\\n', u\"\\nDan stop thinking you know what everyone thinks. It doesn't sound to me like Bernie supporters want to move forward, just re-litigate the past. Hillary primary wins were pretty significant in important states; the link is below. See OxIOX120. When down tickets were voted upon in Nebraska and Washington state Bernie and Hillary were added to the ballots. Hillary won in a land slide. When I posit information like this to Bernie supporters, I am told no one cared since Bernie was not on the ballot and there were many no-shows for that reason. Pouters and people that don't care about congressional seats are the guys we are supposed to get behind? Your language is like a hostage taker. I am curious; why don't you move forward with your own political apparatus if you hate democrats so? The Bernie constituency is strong enough without the democrats you malign? Even if favorable laws are passed in the future, the SCOTUS will now just shoot the down. The new nominee is probably only slightly older than you.\\n\", u\"\\nIt is interesting to note that there were no massive demonstrations when Obama was elected. True, the Republicans subsequently attempted to stymie his every move, but that was mainly politics as usual, with additional pressure from the Tea Party, whose motives are a bit more suspect, since no one complained about debt ceilings in the Bush administration just prior. Democrats have never had the kind of organization that the Republicans seem to enjoy, and their choices for candidates this past election are arguably what led to their defeat. The sad fact is that they, and the establishment Republicans, are sadly, totally out of touch with mainstream America, and despite what you or I may think of Trump, he saw and tapped into the anger and frustration of those who feel that they have been disenfranchised by both parties for decades, and rode that anger and frustration to the White House. That is the lesson that needs to be learned by the Democratic leadership; that without your traditional blue collar, high school educated middle class base behind you, you are just a bunch of college graduates playing identity politics. It doesn't matter that you won the popular vote because you lost the electoral vote, which is all that counts, (which, incidentally, shows really poor strategic planning). The leadership at the top is hidebound: change is desperately needed, yet the same old people were reelected to the leadership of the party just recently. From my perspective, the best thing to do is what Garrison Keillor suggested: take a break, relax, do some gardening and let the Republican president, House and Senate do what they will. It will either validate their goals and ensure a Republican president for at least four more years, or will ensure that the Democrats get another chance to get it right in 2020 because the Republicans screwed things up so badly. What neither of the parties will acknowledge is that because of their partisan shortsightedness, they have both failed the American people, so for better or worse, Trump represents our turn.\\n\", u\"\\nCorporate free-loading isn't free.

Advising the white working class that they are racist to ague against nothing less than unfettered, unmeritorious queue jumping is hardly constructive. \\nI want a nationalized healthcare system, state-funded education for all, an expanded public transportation system, rebuilding of failed and failing infrastructure and an end to the insanity of militarization and adventurism.

Seeing the organic support a candidate like Bernie generated helped embolden voters to think 3rd party (even tho he ran under the D ticket), and the outcry for 3rd party I'm reading across boards from all over the country is heartening. We'll have to see how it pans out given the next 4 years, and most importantly, who comes forward as a candidate. If it's the same-old, same-old Stein and Johnson, we're screwed.

Citizens United is a group formed by... citizens!

The FEC decided that the movie advocated a political view (no kidding!) and banned it from being shown in the month prior to the election.\\nThe government argued that by pooling their money together this group of citizens forfeited their 1st Amendment protections. That only the very rich (who don\\'t need to pool their money together to publicize their political views), politicians, and political parties should be allowed to influence elections. \"Progressives\" apparently agree.\\nIf the case had been decided the other way then The Guardian, the New York Times, CNN, NBC, Sony pictures, and all other media corporations would be subject to whatever censorship any unit of government - federal, state, or municipal - deemed necessary for any reason or no reason. There will no longer be a 1st Amendment freedom of expression reason to overrule the censorship. This is, apparently, a desirable thing for \"progressives\". It never occurs to them that in their zeal to censor a movie critical of their darling Hillary Clinton they open the door wide open to censorship of ideas they hold dear. Long-term effects of their policies never seem to be a consideration for progressives, everything is decided by what feels good at the moment.\\nAnd that\\'s why if progressives ever get their way totalitarianism and fascism will soon follow.\\n', u'\\nwe need radical leftism.\\n', u'\\n\\nI fear there is some wishful thinking in the idea that the US electorate was crying out for a social justice platform.\\n\\nBut Bernie\\'s campaign wasn\\'t just what the Left would think of as a \"Social Justice\" campaign.

As she campaigned, she knocked on many hundreds of doors throughout our ward. And in doing so, she met Republican after Republican who stated \"If the Democrats had run Bernie, I would have voted for him over Trump. But I will NEVER, EVER vote for Clinton.\"\\nPeople wanted change and they were very willing to look to Bernie Sanders for that change. But when the Democrats foreclosed on that path, those voters turned to Trump to obtain the change they were desperate to see occur.\\nSanders would have captured progressive voters but he would have also captured votes from across the spectrum. He is authentic, caring, and able to speak his mind and all of those characteristics would have made him a success precisely where Clinton failed.\\n', u\"\\n\\nYou said that further up the page (and I'll guess further down the page).\\n\\nRepetition is at the heart of successfully launching propaganda.\\n\", u\"\\nI think the vast majority of the votes were anti Trump and any Democrat would have gotten them.\\nClinton did not get them in the states that matters, her primary opponent would have won those states.\\nAnd why this matters, why the Clinton really won argument is very dangerous and needs to be defeated is if the Clinton-Democrats force another corporate Democrat on us in 2020 we will have another 'victory' like this one.\\n\", u'\\nThis is a terrible suggestion. Intellectual puritanism will drive a wedge between people at a time when we need to work together. This sort of \"all or nothing\" attitude is in part what has led to the current problem. So, no.

Trump played the \"Rust Belt\" for rubes... We have to remind them they are smart, industrious, people who are capable of so much more than cracking coal and watching beer bottles come down a line like a Laverne & Shirley.\\nWe also have to remind the Country we are the home of the BRAVE!

The author of the article was proclaiming in November 2014, in New Left Review, \"we stand in total opposition to the Obama administration.\" He was very proud that his magazine, Jacobin, had not swallowed Obama liberalism. His inspirations are Trotsky and the Eurocommunists, notably Italian Communist Party. To the extent that he is posing as a Democrat in this article, he is traveling under a false flag.\\n', u'\\nExactly. Party meetings of late have been depressing parades of office holders, NGO executives, academics, and politically connected lawyers, with not a building trades.union, Teamster, or manufacturing Union member in sight. One attending, a recent college grad, introduced herself to me as the newly minted LGBTQI program coordinator for a nearby university. I asked her what that paid, and she cheerfully told me it was a donor funded slot at $70K per year. (Some of their adjunct and associate professors are lucky to make $25 K. ) The Democratic party \"to-do\" lists are 100% major donor driven. That\\'s why I supported Sanders. His motley crew went door to door in our town. Nice folks. The Clinton people were busy downtown with top-shelf fund raisers and top dollar donors.\\n', u'\\nCitizens United is a vote for CEO speech, not citizen speech. Citizens already have free speech. AND, who says corporations are owned by and represent citizens?\\n', u'\\nI have to call BS on your claim. It is the illusion of being about the constitution.

And all states turn a blind eye to the ghost class, illegal employers. So we now have protected classes, 1%, illegal and legal immigrants, illegal employers, for whom the law may or may not apply, depending on the day/circumstances.In so many ways, \"law\", creation and enforcement, is in meltdown.\\n', u'\\nThank you!

They've gone off the deep end and might as well drown. Last week's video of the candidates for the DNC chairmanship was revealing. Might as well start a new party. I've been a Democrat all my life and it's just disgusting what the party has become.\\n\", u'\\nRe: \"The Democrats lost because Clinton was a screwup.\"\\nSo the Russians told us.\\n', u'\\nDead right. The DNC needs a total overhaul and house-cleaning. Sanders is in command of the message that can win elections. No more centrism!\\n', u\"\\nNo idea why you feel the need to be snarky. I was polite to you.\\nEvery politician can say they bent over backwards trying to win votes. I may be wrong about this - I'm British and get this stuff secondhand. But during the primaries I did notice a fair few Clinton supporters sounding surprised and in some cases horrified that a lot of Millenial women prefered Sanders.\\nDo young people overwhelmingly go for male candidates? I haven't seen a breakdown by age but I'd be stunned if Trump got most of the vote among under-30s. But young people consistently poll as less bigoted on gender, race, and especially sexuality. As for Sanders, the thing about picking on merit is that 50% of the time, all else being equal, that means picking a guy.\\nI think there is bias against female politicians here and in the US. I just don't think there's much of it among Millennials. I think people supporting Clinton relied on a pro-female bias among young people that turned out not to exist.\\n\", u\"\\nThat's exactly right.\\n\", u'\\nThe old adage \"two wrongs don\\'t make a right\" come to mind here. We have evolved into a world of extremes where winning is more important than solutions. As frustrated as I have been with the DNC, they are still our best hope of bringing sanity back to government. I realize that business is usual will just get us another Trump. But the opposition to the radical right is not the radical left. It is pragmatism. It is working to solve problems in a rational, non-ideological manner. The DNC can be a vehicle for that. Fighting them will not get us there. Engaging them and helping them understand their past mistakes can. I happen to think they are in a place where they might actually listen. What other choice do they have? By fighting each other and not the true enemy, Trump, we only weaken ourselves. And maybe we have an opportunity to help the Democratic party find its soul again.\\n', u\"\\nAnd we know they assumed this because... she bent over backwards trying to earn their votes. Yes, a lot of her supporters were shocked that young women supported the guy with the horrible record rather than the woman with the excellent one. But that doesn't change that she fought, the whole time, for every vote she got - much as people liked to pretend otherwise.\\nAnd yes, young people often genuinely believe that gender is irrelevant to competence, which we know because they... overwhelmingly go for the male candidates.\\nOh, no, wait, the actual evidence shows that both your claims are wrong. Sorry about that. Facts: inconvenient sometimes, aren't they?\\n\", u'\\nIn November I voted for three Republicans for the first time in 25 plus years of voting. This article is spot on.\\n', u'\\nActually, 137,000 people voted. Or 54.6% of the voting age population. Similar to 54.9% in 2012.The Democrats lost because Clinton was a screwup.\\n', u'\\nTrump was elected because people did not vote. End of story. Progressives allowed themselves to be taken in by right wing propaganda. We will succeed if we find a way to all work together. Who will decide the identify of \"the establishment democrats\". No political party will survive a \"purity test\". Democrats are fickle voters who only vote in the presidential election. Republicans have control over most State Governments, the US House, Senate and now the White House. The elected Democrats can hardly be blamed for people who fail to vote. Unless you want to say they \"did not excited you enough\" in which case you are confusing public service and porn.\\n', u'\\nWhat you call \"progressive\" many of us see as a dangerous flirtation with totalitarianism and fascism. Progressives are frustrated that people are free to voice opposing views, and they then try to shut those views down by \"any means necessary\", including violence as we saw just a few days ago at the Portland airport when anti-Trump protesters violently attacked a counter-protester, knocked him unconscious, and then stood chanting slogans over his motionless body. Then they had the gall to chant \"peaceful protest\" when the police were trying to move them away so the paramedics could get to him. \\nOn a much more broad scale attack on the 1st Amendment progressives are furious over the Citizens United ruling, in which the Supreme Court ruled the government could not ban a movie about Hillary Clinton prior to the 2008 election. The Obama Administration\\'s attorney Elena Kagan (now a Supreme Court justice) argued that the 1st Amendment doesn\\'t apply to speech produced with corporate funds. If the court had agreed (and it scares the hell out of me that 4 justices did agree) then all speech produced with corporate funds - from Hollywood movies to books published by corporations to music produced by recording corporations and even to the 99,5% of news media that is corporate-owned (including this very site and all the comments within it) would be stripped of 1st Amendment protections. If that is \"progressive\" then count me out!\\n', u'\\n\\n\"There is no doubt that this stance will put like-minded leftists and liberals in direct confrontation with establishment Democrats and their assorted lackies.\"\\n\\nBernie Sanders supported Hillary at the end. Did he become a lackey then, or was he always a lackey, deep down?\\n', u'\\nI find the constant use of the term \"resistance\" puzzling, or perhaps pathetic. How, exactly, is this different from the \"obstructionism\" that Democrats complained of in past years (from Republicans)? Practically speaking, if you\\'re opposed to everything from Trump\\'s administration, your opposition is simply reflexive and has little persuasive ability.\\n', u'\\nWhat \"most\" Americans wanted was for Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States, or perhaps you\\'ve forgotten that she got nearly 3 million more votes than he orange faced degenerate pervert you voted for.\\n', u'\\nThe Tea Party was all about the Constitution, and they were spurred to action because both parties were letting cronyism and corruption interfere with their own oaths to uphold and protect the Constitution. The movement described on this page is about as anti Constitution as it gets. Socialism is not compatible with a free people. This is the problem with Democratic Socialists, who are actually just Socialists. Appeal for more charities or volunteerism, or to change the Constitution, not go around it.\\n', u\"\\nThe next time your home needs repair I sure hope whatever tools and materials the contractor needs can fit in a Prius! In the meantime I'll continue to use my SUV to haul tools and material to my job site, while progressives roll their eyes as I drive by because they can't even see what I have to haul around every day and just see a lone person in a larger vehicle.\\n\", u\"\\nOne of the leaders and organizers of the women's march (Linda Sarsour) describes herself as a HAMAS supporter. The anti-Trump protesters claim Trump is an anti-Semite despite his Jewish daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren and then get lead around by the nose by a woman who supports a group that openly supports genocide of the Jews. It's surreal.\\n\", u'\\nThere is no such thing as \"doing nothing\" in politics. By choosing not to engage with one party I am demonstrating beyond any reasonable measure of doubt that the party should not exist. When others join me in doing so, the party will either change or die.\\nThis is the lie of absolutism; there is no such thing as \"doing nothing.\" Not voting is still voting, but it\\'s a vote that says \"I feel disenfranchised.\" The system can either address that or it can not. But it\\'s worth noting that systems that fail to address broad disenfranchisement inevitably and invariably collapse.\\n', u\"\\nThis is true. You know what happens when the water is slowly brought to a boil? The frog stays in and dies. Trump may have brought it to a boil just fast enough to wake these idiots up, but will they fall back asleep after a few slick Democratic campaign ads? Most likely. I'm not sure what is broken about American culture that prevents us from having a progressive party, but I hope I'm wrong. I hope our extraordinarily credulous electorate actually manages to keep its eyes open. By the look of these comments, we're probably just going to turn the flame down a bit and slowly cook ourselves once our current worst president so far in my lifetime gets out of office.\\n\", u'\\n\"Donald Trump has power, but he doesn\\u2019t have much of a mandate yet\"\\nHe won the election. That is the mandate.\\n', u'\\nJust noticed an auto correct error.

If people like this author had supported the democratic candidate instead of making up conspiracy theories about her Trump never would have been elected and all of Obama's progress wouldn't have been thrown in the garbage. Keep needlessly dividing the party and chasing supporters away and we 'll just be in for more and more Trump and people like him.

There is nothing more American than our national parks. Tracts of land set aside with the idea of preserving them for all to see and experience.

It\\'s beyond Republican or Democrat. It\\'s American. It\\'s at the heart of our people and our people are more divided today than ever before.

I cast my first ballot at 19. How many 19 year olds voted this year? Fewer than 50%. The highest ever youth turnout was in 1992 - 48.6%.

The aspiration to be seen as holding both sides to account meant it struggled to make the point that there was no comparison e.g. between the questions about Clinton's ethics and Trump's consistent outright lying and opacity about his financial affairs. I think the media failed in the task of transmitting the truth that Trump was nothing like a normal candidate.

Whole fleets of species will migrate thousands of miles in search of food sources that have died or fled ahead of them.

I wouldn\\'t expect your breed of Republican to care about anything that\\'s neither edible nor spendable. So this isn\\'t a eulogy for the penguins, Mr. PaytonCat; it\\'s a eulogy for you and me. In the last ten years Antarctica has developed vast regions of exposed rock, something not seen in dozens of millions of years. Hundreds of cubic miles of ice have begun to melt at an accelerated rates in the past ten years. All of that drives ocean level rise, so quickly now that scientists constantly revise their estimates upward. Latest projections show a large portion of Manhattan underwater within 80 years.

And that's the problem with the Democratic Party, it's become a regional party centered in big cities and the coasts whose biggest supporters are the poor who rely on them for government handouts and the wealthy elite who feel entitled to tell everyone else how they should live. The rest of the country just wants to live their lives as they wish without Big Brother looking over their shoulder and cluck-clucking over the things they do which the Party elite disapproves. If they keep going in that direction, as the author thinks they should, they will only become more isolated and concentrated. I think they are going to be in for a shock in the 2018 midterms, particularly if Trump keeps delivering on his promises. Traditionally Democrats have low voter turnout for midterms, and this time they have 25 Senate seats up for grabs (versus just 8 for the GOP), 10 of those in states won by Trump. If they keep up with the obstructions to satisfy their rabid and infuriated base they just might lose 8-12 Senate seats.\\n\", u\"\\nI don't think that's a fair comparison at all, primary voters vs general election voters.\\nTruth is both Hillary and Trump were nearly universally reviled and people were voting against them, not for them. They inspired people with hate for one another, not with a positive message.\\nAs preliminary polls showed, and I truly believe, Bernie would have crushed Trump because he is likeable, isn't scandal plagued or corrupt, talks about issues that Americans care about. I've heard from many people in various comment sections who are independent voters or even republicans that said they would have voted for Bernie Sanders but never for Hillary. And people who wouldn't have voted at all but were literally scared and disgusted by her, and that motivated them to go out and vote.\\nWe need more dogs in the fight, but not the neoliberal, warhawk, wall street loving corporate cronyism establishment blue dog democrats who claim to be progressive but have more in common with republican views and policies. Those factions need to actually become progressive or fade into irrelevance like HRC. If the establishment pushes another out of touch, unlikeable fatcat technocrat like Hillary, Obama, Kerry, or Gore - we're going to be looking at 8 years of Trump.

Trump has never cared about any of his employees and at this point he will promise much to all the people he needs to make himself look good and will simply blame the democrats for doing what we expect them to do which is to obstruct him and his republican cronies for the next four years. After all the gerrymandering the republicans have gotten away with over the years virtually guaranteeing them a majority in both houses and much of it on the democrats watch, we're all up shit creek without a paddle. How much bs did he promise the people in Scotland? What does he do when he doesn't get his way? Unless the democrats oppose him over everything he wants they're going to be history just like the AG whom he just fired for refusing to go along with a clearly unconstitutional act and just because Trump wants something doesn't make it law, force the houses to vote on all of it so that their names not just Trumps will be attached to it, the republicans are currently going to let as well as help him get away with anything he desires since what he wants is what they want and considering they are in control of all of it for the next four years, which they're planning on turning into eight lord help us all, they can afford to sit back with their feet up while they thank their lucky stars and make plans which will make it impossible for anyone to correct even when/if they're not enjoying the majority they now have, a lot of damage can be done even in just four years.\\n\", u'\\nThis author, insofar as he gives the impression that he is a Democrat, is a -- well, you decide what he is.

Unlike most of the US left, we definitely didn\\u2019t jump on the progressives-for-Obama bandwagon.\" \\nWhat are his goals, and who are his models? Hear it from him: \"I\\u2019d hope for a break with the Democrats much more than Harrington did. ...Several of us came from traditions intellectually inspired by Trotskyism, without ever quite becoming Trotskyists. ...We were very interested in the experience of the Italian Communist Party and other mass parties in Europe, and in the theorists of Eurocommunism\\u2014something that distinguishes us from a lot of Trotskyists.\"\\nIt is hard not to conclude that people such as the author (and also Kevin Zeese, who in an opinion piece in the Guardian in August declared that because it was completely impossible for Trump to be elected, there was no excuse not to vote for Jill Stein) actively desired this result. They wanted a shattering of the Democratic Party in order to build a left-wing movement out of the ruins, as the author is now advocating. This is the same strategy that Stalin forced on the German Communist Party, by making it treat the Social Democrats rather than the Nazis as the prime enemy, and we see where that got us. \\nOf course, the author and his apologists will say that I am quoting him out of context. So by all means, please read the full article for yourself. New Left Review, No. 90, Nov-Dec 2014. I, for one, think that anyone who can write \"we stand in total opposition to the Obama administration\" is just a Mitch McConnell of the left, and equally deserving of contempt.\\n', u'\\nSo the left is violent but the Canadian mass shooter and Trump supporter is just fine? you conservatives lack all self reflection.\\n', u\"\\nThe third party vote is the feel good about themselves for voting as opposed to not voting wasted vote. To act as though HRC was pure is to ignore what we didn't want that would have gone with her and she won the popular vote, so trying to label us as idiots who didn't hold our noses and vote for her anyway is lame. What needs to be looked at is why so many people voted for the blob and that's all about to play out in full once those people decide they can do all those things they've been wanting to do for years to people they don't like based on color religion etc. Maybe when what the republicans finally do has an impact on their families and their freedoms will they finally wake up to what they've done, that's why he's going for the Muslims first as well as the wall, he must appease them if he expects them to back him up for everything else he and the Republicans are going to do to all of us.\\n\", u'\\nDo you check out the Washington Post everyday? It has the best, most detailed U.S. political information--right now there is an article \"Progressives Cheer Democratic Obstruction\"--Sherrod Brown, Stabenow, Merkeley and many other are working to working to prevent and expose Trump\\'s Cabinet nominees. They are using walk-outs, filibustering, Congressional rules, etc. They are working to protect the country.\\n', u\"\\nWe've got to be careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater, Obama had very high approval ratings when he left office and I think that says something. I'm also curious as to how many of those protesting chose to not vote for Hilary Clinton and thus indirectly allowed the current situation to happen. Converting marches to votes is no easy task, though building a broad coalition to oppose Trump should be easy enough, he's just that unpopular. A very different situation than what Corbyn and Labour have in the UK, though Corbyn should also be a warning to the Dems. This is what happens when grassroots movements go wrong (specifically talking about his low approval ratings and his triple line whip that's alienated many of this strongest supporters).\\n\", u'\\nhow did that support of her work for you?\\n', u\"\\nGood thing the those hard-working millennials on the Sanders campaign didn't pack it in after the primary. They already have a plan in place to rebuild the Congress in 2018 and are actively seeking and vetting candidates. I hope they succeed.  https://brandnewcongress.org/plan\\n\", u'\\nI recognize your frustration but could you please explain to me how you define \"neoliberalism\" because it is unclear in your article. \\nI think your argument has a tactical issue. You jump straight to 2018 but I think we can and should aim to remove him sooner (look at attack in Yemen). To do that we need to impeach him and that means we need to turn some conservatives. The best way to do that is through libertarianism. Don\\'t focus on the Bern\\'s Socialism, it gives the Republicans the economic argument. \\nWhat we really need is a centrist libertarian movement.\\n', u'\\nYour sky fairy had nothing to do with the Mango Mussolini being where he is now Abigail. Just like he/she/it had anything to do with politics, or anything else for that matter, at any time prior either.\\n', u\"\\nYes but that will never happen with the Greens, about the only thing that would work would be a labor party because that is who either suffers or prospers depending on what the two party's we're stuck with now decide is best for them.\\n\", u\"\\nAbigail -- I take that to be a woman's name. A prime exhibit that proves what I wrote about American women and their willingness to preserve the patriarchy in an earlier post.\\n\", u\"\\nActually it was the 43 percent of the population that stayed home like pouting little bitches that handed us Trump. Ya know some years you don't get the cake and pony but you still show up the party. Hope that 43 percent enjoys every shitty thing president Bannon ...eh Trump does to them.\\n\", u'\\nAlmighty Father, we praise and worship You and thank You forgiving us Donald J. Trump our President. Thank you for his great ability indecision making that he may lead us, Your children out of darkness and into thelight. Thank you for this great man and his strong presence in the White House.Protect him and guide him in Your great love and mercy for us. Heavenly Father,we thank and praise you for this good father and good man, President Donald J.Trump who cares and watches over not only his own children, but We the Peopleof the United States of America in accordance with Your Divine Providence andWill under the Constitution you most graciously guided our Founding Fathers togive us. And bless and guide Justice Neil Gorsuch whom You in Your DivineWisdom brought to the attention of President Donald J. Trump. In the Name of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Amen!\\n', u'\\nNo we want to take it all back and make it into an improved version of itself, rebuild it and what is it about people like you who seem to think we don\\'t currently enjoy socialism and why do you all insist on attaching communism to socialism. Look at all the crowds Bernie was able to generate, had HRC and the DNC cronies not forced him to bow out and yes had Bernie himself not been so \"nice\" about things regarding her when she was going for his jugular we might not even be having this discussion. It\\'s a fight no matter how you might wish it to be a civil affair and when you\\'re in a fight, as Bruce Lee once said, it doesn\\'t matter what style it is or type use it if it will help you win. Democrats have got to toss this whole holier than thou because we don\\'t do that we\\'re the \"nice\" people/party and all they\\'ve done is prove that old adage of nice guys finishing last.\\n', u'\\nBill Clinton won with 43%.\\n', u\"\\nThe purpose of elections is to let the voters decide who leads them. That they don't select your choices was no reflection on their abilities at self governance. Rather it is a test of your ability to accept an outcome that you don't favor. They had the right. They used it.\\n\", u'\\nYeah, not voting for Democrats worked out great for the Bernie or Busters.\\n', u'\\nYou cannot discount a desire to protect the patriarchy by both men and women in middle America as another important reason Trump won. By and large American women are not as inclined to assert their position in society as equals as European women are. In that sense they are more like some third world societies than women in western democracies. For that matter, countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have made far more progress in their willingness to grant political power to women than the United States.\\n', u\"\\nFairly sickening misogynistic fire?Have you been involved in politics long? That is a piss poor way to change people's political views.\\n\", u'\\nNot to mention how many times must the \"greens\" be told that if they ever expect to seriously become an actual party they\\'d best start at the bottom like everyone else and get themselves elected to political positions in order to at least get as far as Bernie did/is.\\n', u\"\\nOk why don't you explain that little bump in the road called an electoral college as well as why'll you're at it the popular vote.\\n\", u\"\\nOh for God's sake, read some history. If you don't think the Democratic Party has fought for civil rights, women's rights, minority rights, worker's rights you are just ignorant. We would never have made any progress at all in the last 50 years without strong Demoratic Congresses. Take a look at who Obama got into the Supreme Court, at marriage equality, the fight against voter suppression, at raising the minimum wage--it was always the Democrats. The belief that they are as bad as the Republicans really pisses me off.\\n\", u'\\nWe already are a minority and you want to fracture us further? Not a good idea at all.\\n', u\"\\nYes and no, I can't believe I'm still getting emails asking me to call my Senators because so and so overheard them saying to each other that not many people are calling them to complain/insist on the things that are the reason we voted them in to office in the first place! They need to do the Obvious and if they don't know what that is with the blob destroying everything he gets his greedy little hands on then they should just quit and let someone who doesn't sit waiting for the calls to come in and guess what-they'd damn well better start counting as legitimate all of the emails we do send to them or have they really got no time to go thru them all.\\n\", u'\\nWell, well. Is that all you have?\\nAll I have to say is if your vaunted capitalist economic system is to work in any way it needs consumers. And the consumers are the workers. No workers, no consumption, no capitalism. And to be honest I can\\'t wait for the whole rotten oligarchic system to collapse in on itself because of the greed of the people at the top of it.\\nOh, and btw, the USSR wasn\\'t an example of \"communism\". It was a kleptocratic military dictatorship which enriched the people at the top of government...which actually sounds like what we currently have in the US and what Trump plans to expand upon.\\n', u'\\nOh yeah, fracture up the opposition to Trump--it worked so well in Nov. Just because someone is older or seems \"establishment\" doesn\\'t mean they haven\\'t been working for progress for years. UNITY is what is needed--there are many good Democratic politicians in office and they\\'re fighting the good fight now. We can have many faction working against the Republican and the big Orange dumbkoff, but let\\'s have them working together! \" We should all hang together or surely we will hang separately.\"\\n', u'\\nMore like an insanity someone came up with called the electoral college which guaranteed the votes of the people being what determines who gets to be POTUS null and void.\\n', u\"\\nIt's not about throwing people off the truck (except for the neoliberal establishment dems who have proven they can't win) it's about getting the truck turned around and going in a better direction.\\n\", u\"\\nThose are fair points. We shouldn't expect everyone to just get in line behind the Sanders platform.But on the other hand we should acknowledge that the Clinton message didn't resonate and that this was an election the Democrats should have won . Clinton had universal media support, sometimes worryingly uncritical support. She also had a huge marketing budget and the support of corporate American and of the Davos set. To lose with all of that against a candidate as bad as trump (he got less of the registered electorate than McCain or Romney) Is a terrible performance. But I get you, we have to come together.\\n\", u'\\nhow much you get paid per nonsense post matey?\\n', u\"\\nSee below. I know her to be a plagiarist, and bloated book mill. There are better Lincoln scholarship than hers, easily. So who's wasting who's time?\\n\", u'\\nIt\\'s true. If you are counting on Chuck Schumer, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Elizabeth Warren to lead anyone, good luck. But I don\\'t think those marchers are the ticket either. They are cathartic, but they are the equivalent of the Tea Party not just objecting to more taxes, but to be demanding zero taxes. Those marches and protests are literally filled with \"no borders\" as the response to immigration moves by Trump. That\\'s just not going to fly.\\nI know it\\'s tempting to fight crazy with crazier, but that won\\'t last.\\n', u\"\\nTrue but HRC is DOA, she'll never be taken seriously nor win any votes based on her gender or her track record, she's over and done with and good riddance.\\n\", u\"\\nthat's a sad, defeatist mentality. Nothing will ever change or get better so just shit on yourself, huh? You must be fun at parties\\n\", u\"\\nNo sorry it had nothing to do with her gender and everything to do with her past and at the time current actions as SOS. Need to trash the entire gender angle, we vote based on qualifications and we're all really tired of the same old business as usual with the Dems.\\n\", u\"\\nThe Clinton campaign had almost universal uncritical support from the media. It also had a massive marketing budget and the wholehearted support of the DNC.\\nClinton's policy contained nothing about income inequality, far and away the most important issue in the US today. In fact she had the poor judgement to accept millions in speaking fees from wall street shortly after a recession caused by the financial services sector that wrecked millions of Americans' lives. \\nTrump was an extremely weak candidate from an extremely weak group of republican candidates. He should have been beaten easily. But clinton had terrible approval ratings , she was involved in the Libyan fiasco and she even voted for Iraq (the biggest disaster since Vietnam). \\nSanders' platform was not bizarre or unreasonable. Most of it has been tried and tested in western Europe. The current iteration of capitalism, which is based in large part on the economics of Reagan and Thatcher, is no longer working for the majority of people. Sanders is suggesting genuine solutions to this as opposed to tweaking a broken system. You should get behind him.\\n\", u\"\\nPhoto IDs are essential for many aspects of modern life, and 96% of the population manages to acquire one when needed without assistance. The Democratic Party, with the smartest and most caring people on the planet, could mount its enormous skills and resources to ensure that any American who needed a valid photo ID would get one in order to buy beer, go into a government building, board an airplane, or vote. Instead, they point to those who don't have IDs as a reason to void their requirement in voting, but not for any other purposes. It is a campaign issue because they want it as an issue instead of simply fixing the problem.\\n\", u\"\\nYou'd think the fact that the Republicans have no third party alternative to vote for and never had would make someone in the Democrats wake the hell up! Bump Trump.\\n\", u\"\\nOne could argue Trump won partly because stubborn, childish democrats didn't move towards the center and support a candidate not really that different from Bernie...\\n\", u\"\\nSo true. The old guard are just clueless and their mindset doesn't work for the majority of us, they've forgotten all about us in their quest for personal gain plus kissing up to the Reps who simply screw them for doing so. If they're to gain back any seats in 2018 then they'd better weed out all of the ones who refuse to wake up, it was precisely them who gave the WH to Trump and nothing but grief to many for the next four years. Bump Trump!\\n\", u\"\\nMeans there's no more fight in the unions.\\n\", u\"\\nYour mistake is in believing socialism and capitalism are mutually exclusive. The fact is, either one, without the other, is utterly ruinous. \\nThe trick is how to get the balance just right. What we're seeing now is a rising tendency towards fascism, the inevitable consequence of the balance swinging too far in favour of capitalism.\\nThe balance began to shift when Reagan and Thatcher managed to persuade the rest of the world into a neo-liberal consensus. That consensus disintegrated with the recent Great Depression. \\nHowever, Reagan and Thatcher are still idolised by the right-wing establishment, who have yet to acknowledge the utter failure of their neo-liberal project. And until such time as this failure is acknowledged, the right-wing establishment will continue to torch and divide society by blaming everybody else.\\n\", u\"\\nThere were significant policy differences between the two candidates and huge differences in their legislative and executive records. There is little reason aside from your own bias to assume Sander's voters were motivated by misogyny.\\n\", u'\\nGood column. The Democlicans are not even a party worth voting for any more.\\n', u\"\\nYep, I've said it before, and I've said it again. This past election couldn't make it any more clear - the neoliberal, center right, establishment 'democrats' are dinosaurs and have to go. They don't have the correct positions or policy or platform. They don't inspire or offer a better vision for the future. They're crusty old relics with a dirty past of compromise, capitulation and crony corruption. They try to be in the middle of the political spectrum and are distasteful to both sides, trying to please democrats and republicans doesn't broaden their appeal, it lessens it to both.\\nWe really need a 50 state progressive movement at all levels and to get the youth vote out, all the people who came out for Bernie Sanders, tap that enthusiasm. Talk about the issues important to them, to everyone and propose solutions. This is the way forward. Establishment dems are the way backwards.\\n\", u\"\\nOk, you got me, trump is specifically targeting people for their religion/nationality rather than their 'race', so I guess that's fine then.\\nAs to the second question, did you read my post? Trump asked Guliani to help him write a Muslim ban and clearly understands the EO as such, even if of course it leaves out those countries whose higher ups might be investors in his resorts.\\n\", u\"\\nI agree. The left wing has become radicalized. A bunch of intolerant, violent, easily manipulated people. It scary how misinformed people can be led around like marionettes. Democrats live in closed world...all informtion comes from 'beliefs' and not hard data. They sure as hell don't represent America's core values anymore. Personally, I think Trump needs to ban government pale grants for all politicized colleges and assaults based on political affiliations should be a hate crime.\\n\", u'\\n\\n\"Our response in the labor movement must be to support rank-and-file struggles against leaders prone to conciliation ...\"\\n\\nHmmm. One wonders if the author has ever been a rank-and-file member of an industrial trade union.\\n', u\"\\nSo boycott Microsoft, Wal-Mart, Facebook, and all other billionaire-owned outfits.\\nIt's you and other consumers keeping those mega-capitalists afloat. Stop it!\\n\", u'\\nYeah, all you need is a US Corbyn LOL.\\n', u\"\\nHillary had as much to do with Trump winning as Trump did. The emails proved that she is a crook, a liar, and a fraud. Problem is she may be back in 4 years to run interference for Trump. In that case, Trump is guaranteed 4 years. Trump is going to deliver enough of what he promised to satisfy his base, and the way the electoral college is designed he will win on points again. The best thing could happen to the Democrats is for Hillary to retire. \\nBernie and Warren are both old. Although I would like to see Bernie run again. Warren I can't stand personally. In my opinion she would be the worst president we have ever had. She certainly would be the weakest.\\n\", u\"\\nComrade, capitalism can never guarantee employment for everyone. You must be thinking of the failed soviet system where everyone was guaranteed a job even it meant there were surplus street sweepers.\\nSocial Democracy? What is that. Doesn't seem like democracy to me. Who decides what rights everyone gets? Certainly not the people. A universal livable retirement? You think the people that worked their whole lives really want to pay for the people that were lazy? I think not. But I suppose if you get enough people addicted to drugs, then you will have the majority you need to force your brand of socialism on the people that actually do all the work and support everyone else.\\n\", u'\\nUS was ready for change but Democrats wanted to protected its dynasty and vested interest. If Sanders ran in the presidential election, he would have trumped Trump, but nope the Democrats was too greedy at protecting their vested interests.\\n', u\"\\nwe have not had a liberal agenda in any real sense since LBJ's war on poverty.\\nspare us the age old saw about neo liberals and how those limolibs have done this to themselves. the fallout we are experiencing is because of class warfare practiced against the majority of citizens by the very wealthy and their republican proxies in congress.\\n\", u\"\\nclinton SUCKED for many of us....SUCKED. \\nwhy can't you get that through your fucking head?\\na message has been sent to not send us more of the same bullshit nothing candidates....but we'll have to suffer as a country because the other side didn't worry about the 'most viable' candidate....but followed their twisted heart and elected trump.\\n\", u\"\\ndon't fret. every generation has to listen to some asshole from an older generation talking down to them. and no....he is wrong. you should vote for the candidate you believe in. when one plays the system and tries to game an election....you get candidate by committee....in other words you get a stand for nothing....change nothing....at best blah leader.\\nconviction matters.\\n\", u'\\nNo, more truthfully a \"rabid opposition to\" Clinton, a fairly sickening misogynistic fire that is burning us very badly.

But Trump himself is not really the issue. Both he and Hillary are products of a system unhinged from fundamental human values. \\nBy fundamental values I do not mean \"rhetorically inclusive\" issues like gender toilet access or even police violence or date rape. \"Fundamental\" means those things that have universal application and that means: guaranteed employment at a living wage with paid vacation time, secure and affordable housing, tuition free universal education, universal health care, universal livable retirement. These are things which affect everyone and thus have always been the fundamentals of social democracy. \\nNeo liberals in the US and elsewhere (think Blair, May, Merkel, Rajoy, Vals, Fillon) have been trashing fundamentals while peddling feel good, \"rhetorical inclusion\" which costs corporations nothing. \\nThe current DNC strategy is to cause a lot of Trump-focused angst so that people coming \"running home to Hillary\" like chastened children. \"See?

It particularly noticeable the larger the size of the electorate. \\nThe reasons other countries with FPP have, Britain and Canada, have minor parties is due to substantial geographically distinct cultural differences/identities added to the fact British and Canadian representative districts are much smaller populations than US congressional ones.. Roughly a factor of 10. To have the same proportion of representatives to population as Britain or Canada the US would have something in the order of 4-5000 Reps in Congress. When the US set the House and Senate to 435 and 100 limits regardless of the size of population its meant that new parties have almost zero chance of winning any race outside the small states (i.e. Vermont and Maine). Without a major change to the US electoral system 3rd parties will never be able to build into a viable option. It why in US political history the 2 parties have swapped positions across the political spectrum, because it easier to change a party's political ideology than to start new one.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nNovember\\u2019s election is a powerful reminder that the Clinton establishment\\u2019s mix of socially inclusive rhetoric and neoliberal economics is a weak response to xenophobic populism.\\n\\nYes, this is key. No matter that he either stumbled upon them by accident or else had them fed to him, Trump's best lines against Clinton- jobs, trade, left behind etc. are all things that she had no answer on, and establishment dems don't either. What are you going to do in 2018, stand on a platform of bringing back TPP? \\nDems under Bill Clinton moved to the right because of expediency, not principles. Well, now that strategy is in itself is no longer helpful in winning elections, so what's the point of keeping it? Instead, why not find an answer to those things that Trump used against Clinton. Sanders did have a story to tell on all these things and it was a very different one to Trump's council of fear and hatred. And it worked- look at how much better Sanders did in the hypothetical head-to-heads vs Trump than Clinton ever polled. \\nThe one possible chink of light with Trump is that all bets are off- political certainties are out of the window and while that's potentially dangerous, it also means Dems have an opportunity to break out of the timid attempts to put a human face on neoliberalism which have framed the limits of their ambition for the past 20 years. These crowds gathering are building a powerful sense of what's possible- why not try to harness that?\\n\", u'\\nPerfect example of: \"you see what you want to see\", doesn\\'t mean it\\'s accurate, just a biased and fragile opinion.\\n', u\"\\nTrump won something like 2,600 of the 3,100 counties in America. Clinton won the popular vote but Trump overwhelmingly won the geographic vote.\\nThe reason is because elitist intellectuals never speak to the bush. 'Jobs returned to the United States because of Obama' except to rural areas, where almost nothing has improved. Clinton especially was at fault because she did more then just ignored them, she looked down on them. So yeah, they went to Trump, and that's nobody's fault but the Democrats.\\n\", u'\\nThe other option was palatable. The problem is that those who know-it-all refused to learn that the \"unpalatability\" of Clinton was 30 years of fake \"scandals\" flung at her by Republicans. Not only did those fake \"scandals\" have no substance, they were in every instance proven BASELESS -- by those who made them up and flung them: REPUBLICANS.\\nBut, sure: it\\'s everyone else who is the dupe . . .\\n', u'\\nYou only have to throw of your chains, have you considered therapy.\\n', u'\\nThey had the popular votes in the states that delivered the electoral votes, so clearly it did work and was representative of the republic.\\n', u\"\\nThe whole point is that the US was confronted with two bad candidates. If the other candidate had won, the political choices we are dealing with now would have been saner and probably often good--but the whole e-mail and conflict of interest issue would have haunted the country and sooner or later undermined that presidency. The Democratic Party's leaders are largely responsible for undermining the democratic process in their own party with the Super Delegate system and DWS dirty tricks.\\n\", u'\\nYeah: the party must follow its base, regardless how stupid its base insists on being: \"No Saint Bernie, who wants to burn it all down? Then Trump, who wants to burn it all down. Because Clinton something something is corrupt because not gratuitously destructive.\"\\n', u\"\\nThe sad fact seems to be that Democrats consider but Republicans act. I still feel that Trumps hyperactivity is due to Obama's humbling of him some years ago. Trumps Hubris will no doubt bring some disaster . This is no way to run a Country of this size you need some intelligence and pragmatism in charge.\\n\", u'\\nThe further left one moves, the further one moves AWAY from the majority of voters -- the majority occupying the CENTER so hated by the know-it-all neophytes.\\nSo now the \"Bernie or Bust\" dupes are telling us that the degenerate Trump is preferable to lifelong children\\'s advocate Clinton.\\nYep: the stupidity of know-it-all is preferable to mature judgment.\\n', u\"\\n\\nHardly likely since Trump won the presidency convincingly.\\n\\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/trump-landslide-nope/\\n\\n. Racism was also seen as a primary charge against Brexiteers\\n\\nThis is a Muslim ban. Remember when Trump called for a ban on Muslims? Well, he might have left out countries where he has business interests, but make no mistake, this is a Muslim ban, and that's how he framed it when he asked Guliani to help him put it together after he got elected. If that's not racist, I wonder what you think he'd have to do to qualify- sign executive orders wearing a white hood?\\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/giuliani-trump-asked-me-how-to-do-a-muslim-ban-legally-2017-1?r=US&IR=T\\n\\nthese silly liberals will fail because liberalism is not just about these people. It has a far wider dimension than that held by the people who became despised because they failed to protect the jobs of poor folks. Liberalism in these people's eyes means protecting jobs and possibly those people from countries who represent the greatest threat from terrorist attacks. Like beauty, liberty is in the mind of the beholder.\\n\\nSo to sum up, words mean whatever you want them to mean, you just have to decide they mean something different to what they actually do mean. Well, it's certainly an opinion in keeping with the age of Trump, I'll give you that.\\n\", u\"\\nThe neoliberals legacy is President Trump. They gambled everything on Hillary, a candidate so flawed that she couldn't even beat a racist orangutan. You fixed the primaries, you got the general election against the weakest candidate possible, and you lost. \\nOwn it. Trump is your albatross.\\n\", u\"\\nThe Democratic Party for decades now has failed to present a clear and compelling agenda that would make sense to the part of the population earning less than about 175K yearly. The benefits and protections that citizens in Germany, France, and other countries enjoy do not exist in the United States and US voters for the most part do not understand this or the basics of national healthcare, employee protection, women's issues such as pregnancy leave, childcare and others. \\nWe saw during the 2016 election that the Democratic Superdelegates were unwilling to even discuss these things seriously and basically hid behind the assumed certain election of their chosen candidate.\\nThe Democratic Party is going to have to address these two things at some point or they are not going to take back the two houses of congress or presidency any time soon: the anti-democratic process that led them to back their candidate in 2016 and a clear and compelling agenda that brings the US back into the quality of life of most developed countries.\\nPart of the difficulty of this task has to do with education. As one saw in the election and debates, US citizens, not to speak of politicians are poorly informed about national health care (including its problems) and women's rights and benefits in other countries. The debates and discussions about health care were appalling in their shallowness.\\nAnd then there area the taboo areas---military, geopolitical, the I in the room, the ally in the Middle East. A political reorientation is not possible as long as those things remain hidden.\\nPessimistically...\\n\", u\"\\nIt's amazing how much more about the operation of gov't is known by those who have never been there, but practiced and practiced and practiced 'till proficient at throwing stones at that about which they are clueless.\\nBut it's so easy to hate red herrings.\\n\", u'\\nThere we go with the clich\\xe9 label slingers -- which is a whole lot easier than attempting actually thinking for oneself.\\nTell us, self-righteous, destructive purist: would Clinton be as bad as Trump is going to be?

Might even include a watered down stop and frisk program too. \\n There is a hint of that here:\\n\"To build his highly touted deportation force, President Donald Trump is reviving a long-standing program that deputizes local officers to enforce federal immigration law.\"\\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-enlist-local-police-immigration-crackdown-45123922\\n', u'\\nPartly. And partly because most Americans cannot read, let alone read The Guardian. They cannot read because 50 years of progressively pisspoor public education has produced a vast voting morass that is easily suckered by a malevolent snake oil salesman.\\n', u\"\\nSystematic 'racial gerrymandering' particular in the Southern States has had an endemic effect on registration combined with voter suppression laws to create a chilling effect on minorities particularly (but you probably knew that):Four Southern states in particular\\u2014Alabama, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia\\u2014will be sending their black and Latino voters into somewhat of a whirlwind when they try to cast their ballots. Each of these states is facing recent or pending court decisions around voter ID, felony disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering. Voters in these states are expected to rough it through many doubts as they stand in line for the polls: Do they need ID to vote? What kind? Has a past crime disqualified them from voting or not? Are they even voting from the correct legislative or congressional district?\\nwww.citylab.com/politics/2016/03/voter-id-felony-disenfranchisement-and-racial-gerrymandering-on-super-tuesday/471777/\\n\", u\"\\nYou would think that the demonstrations might represent American opinion in depth. Hardly likely since Trump won the presidency convincingly. Besides, we saw a lot of silly anti-democratic marchers after Brexit who sulked and wanted more referendums until they won the vote. Racism was also seen as a primary charge against Brexiteers but try as they might these attempts failed. \\nThey will also fail in America because despite all of the demonstrations the silent solid majority of America have different ideas to all the screaming folks and just like Brexit the people who voted kept their opinions to themselves. That is why these silly liberals will fail because liberalism is not just about these people. It has a far wider dimension than that held by the people who became despised because they failed to protect the jobs of poor folks. Liberalism in these people's eyes means protecting jobs and possibly those people from countries who represent the greatest threat from terrorist attacks.

We leave that to the Republican Party -- and the fools who refused to vote, or refused to vote Democratic, based upon the mindless nonsense that there are no differences between the parties.\\nThose who push that lie are about to learn the hard way -- along with those who all along knew better -- that they have their heads up their delusions.\\n', u'\\nThis is the answer to Trump in a nutshell. Come together and vote. Thank you for saying it so simply.\\n', u'\\nAgreed. Choosing from the only viable candidates in the race, (Hillary or Trump) who would have best represented the liberal and progressive causes based on policy. That was the only question or choice in the election. How anyone could not understand that before voting is beyond me. Everything else was fluff. Especially the email thing.\\n', u'\\nStop the juvenile hating of labels you are clueless as to meaning and context.

But the know-it-alls who sling labels they don\\'t understand refused to listen and learn that the \"stink\" attached to Clinton was made up and thrown at her BY THE REPUBLICANS. \\nClues:\\n1. Without having to be asked, the Clintons released 39 YEARS of tax returns.\\n2. Sanders REFUSED to release his tax returns because, obviously, he has something to hide -- probably that he has enriched himself during his decades in Congress, so his rumpled \"regular guy\" shtick is a fraud.\\nThere is no way a third party will ever be viable -- a fact borne out by history, which history those who BS about third parties refuse to learn. Exactly as they refused to learn that the \"stink\" attached to Clinton is not Clinton and never was. \\nThere is one thing of which we can be certain: unlike the Sanders \"fans,\" and the Trump \"fans,\" Clinton was the ADULT in the room.\\nAnd note this OBVIOUS fact that the know-it-alls ignored: EVERY investigation of Clinton by the Republicans PROVED HER INNOCENT of whatever the fake \"scandal\" they had thrown at her.\\nNow all of us are going to get an unnecessary, nasty lesson from the fact that stupidity elected Whites Only hate-politics.\\n', u\"\\n\\nDoes anyone really believe that establishment Democrat$ will go down without a fight, even against their own party?\\n\\nWho do you think you're addressing?

If only Hillary had raised more money and those pesky hackers hadn\\'t revealed the facts of her active subversion of the democratic process and utter contempt for true progressive ideals, then surely the spineless dems would have ushered in the new progressive era? \\nYou and your apologist ilk blindly following Obama and HRC down Bush Policy Lane are more to blame than the misinformed and uneducated Trumpettes, who were offered no economic alternative from the crushing status quo. Bernie offered an alternative, and would have decimated Trump, and HRC given a fair fight. It took a Trump win, as a face slap to awaken you largely ambivalent, delusional, whining \"dems\" to see the cancer of Neo-Liberal corruption that has riddle our government for decades. \\nI understand your position. Having to admit that everything you think you know about politics, the faux-progressive backpatting, and your spoonfed Democratic justifications of what is \"fair\" has been an utter lie and smokeshow for the NeoLiberal agenda, requires more pride swallowing, and self-forgiveness, then most people are capable of. You need to let go of the false reality you\\'ve constructed in which Obama, HRC (or Bill) and almost all national Democratic politicians actually stands in favor of issues you pretend they support. \\nTrumpettes are about to learn that 40 years of NeoLiberal Fox-News-esque propoganda is not going to uplift their position, but rather destroy the tattered remains of an egalitarian America, and further reduce the prospects for their children and children\\'s children. The fight is not red vs blue, the fight is against the NeoLiberal elites, using the state and corporate media as a vessel to squeeze as much wealth from the plebians as possible, while fomenting chaos, misdirected rage, misinformation, and infighting among people that share the same hopes, goals and desires, but are so angry or uneducated they can\\'t look past their own self-interests at the greater picture.\\n', u\"\\n\\nHowever, in a general election, Bernie would have also got the vote from independents and moderate Republicans.\\n\\nSome independents, yes, but precious few Republicans of any stripe. Don't kid yourself.\\n\", u'\\nClearly it does not work as twice in the last 20 years the President Inaugurated did not have the popular vote.\\n', u\"\\n\\nPoll after poll said Sanders would win.\\n\\nPoll after poll showed Trump would lose. Obviously, he didn't.\\nDon't put too much of your faith in polls. The only one that counted was on election day.\\n\", u'\\n\\nMany people support his sensible, no doubt legal ban.\\n\\nWhy do you have \"no doubt\" when every court that\\'s ruled on it yet has blocked enforcement of it? Do you think uninformed & unearned confidence is just as good as any other kind? That\\'s a big and inexcusable mistake. \\nWhy, too, do you make the childishly disingenuous mistake of pretending that the number of people who support something is proof of its superiority? Hitler was popular for a while. Many demagogues are. You\\'re also neglecting to mention that among Trump\\'s many supporters are some of the most grotesquely racist and xenophobic people who live in our country, including every white nationalist organization. No, not everyone who supports him is racist, but every racist supports him.\\n', u'\\nWell even that depends. If they voted for Stein and live in California, they didn\\'t do anything to anyone. If you lived in Florida though... then that\\'s a bigger issue. I totally agree (and have made this argument many times) that the smart thing to do is vote for Hillary because the hole won\\'t be as big to dig out of when someone comes along that you do really believe in.\\nThat being said I don\\'t think pointing the finger at \"progressives\" in general is appropriate and if you re-read your first 2-3 posts I think you\\'ll agree that\\'s how you come off. The progressives that refused to vote for Hillary didn\\'t help, that\\'s for sure. But I think blaming Jill Stein voters (much less progressives in general) is misplaced. It\\'s like say someone put their house on the market at a price well above market value, they didn\\'t do the minor repairs that should be done, they don\\'t keep it clean for realtor showings, no fresh coat of paint, no landscaping for curb appeal, but instead of taking responsibility for not doing what they could have done to help sell the house they blame their realtor for not doing the best job they could have. \\nNow maybe the realtor didn\\'t make that listing the #1 priority on their list. Maybe they could have sold it if they had. But the bigger problems that prevented the house from selling were internal.\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m saying. The Dems need to get their shit in order. Why did it take Sally Yates getting fired for Diane Feinstein to get off the fence about Jeff Sessions as AG? Why is Chuck Schumer considering playing footsy with Trump? Why is Corey Booker joining with republicans to kill a measure allowing pharmaceuticals from Canada? The party is a shit show right now. It\\'s not all built on the false equivalencies that dogged Clinton (who has her own real warts too). These aren\\'t controversially liberal stances to take. They don\\'t have to go as far left as Bernie but when they can\\'t take these kind of bare minimum stands on policy and/or values that is why progressives feel betrayed. That is why they feel justified in casting a protest vote. And that is what the Democratic party needs to focus on. If they sweep up around their own doorstep and start taking strong decisive action, the decision making on the back end won\\'t be an issue.\\n', u'\\nI very much disagree. The party will follow its base or die, but meanwhile the movement must influence and use the party. All these years the Greens have had passion and ideas, but no means of legislating. Much better to influence the existing structure than try to create new. It was only last summer that Steve Bannon said \"Trump is just a blunt instrument for us.\" We must make our Representatives and Senators the same for us, hammers to smash Trump and Bannon and all their kind.\\n', u'\\nThe \"progressive\" Democrats legacy is Donald Trump as POTUS, hubris has always been rewarded by being bitten in the ass, hence Trump and fully deserved too.\\n', u\"\\nI'm caught in that fantasy -- or as I like name the dream: statistics.\\nPoll after poll said Sanders would win.

We have a lot of past experience to draw on.\\n\", u'\\nI\\'ve been waiting a long time for a fact-based indictment of Hillary Clinton--it sounds like you might know something. I asked a lot of Trump people to explain. One woman said, \"Well, it\\'s the e-mails and Beghazi.\" I asked her what Clinton had done in Benghazi and she didn\\'t know; when I asked what evils were discovered in the e-mails, she replied \"Well, there were so many of them.\" Do you know more?\\n', u\"\\nIt could be me, but I think many of you are missing the point. When you say we should be sorry for not voting for Hillary and it's our fault we got Trump, or that voting for the not-great 3rd party candidates caused us to get Trump, or whatever reason non-Hillary supporters are to blame for Trump, you are constraining the solution from the outset. I don't think the author is saying screw Democrats. But pretending the current incarnation of the DNC (including Hillary as a candidate) doesn't have too much of the same stink we're seeing from the RNC is disingenuous. In order to not be the hypocrites we claim the right is being with their debt-ballooning, anti-Constitutional, and unethical behavior, we need to clean the left's house too. Part of that is being open to creating and SUPPORTING a viable 3rd party that forces the corrupt 2-party system to compromise and listen to the people in order to stay relevant, rather than the monopoly they now hold.\\n\", u'\\nI would like to believe, but I have found this not to be the case. Generally you marshal your most vocal supporters(true believers) a bit like big Guns before an infantry assault. Then you launch fake news spoilers on new media. After a great furore you then bribe/ blackmail key high representatives to issue ambiguous statements about your opponents. You then walk up to the podium saying things like \"make America Great again\", even though before you started most Americans thought they were OK . Then you offer major tax cuts even though this means that the children of your voters will be condemned to poverty not seen for 90 years. Keep this up for a few decades and you are back to pre Lincoln times before the abolition of slavery. This will be slavery on an equal opportunity basis mostly endured by the non maritime states of America or those without resources.\\nThe key understanding of Bannon et al is that our sense or not of well being is not necessarily based in reality but in our perceptions. If you can distort perceptions then success is at hand. The most brilliant exposition of this in literature is George Orwell\\'s Animal Farm. It is only about 120 pages but it is brilliant. I have read it 3 times and seen a play based on its text. It is one of those universal stories much like Shakespeare that resonates down the years. \\nThe genius of using Animals is that no human actors can be easily identified. Then as now spin, flack, optics and chaff are deployed by all strident political parties\\nI happen to hope that we the people are not as stupid or mendacious as our politicians believe and that what you describe may well become the way.\\n', u'\\nThe sooner that people like Nancy Pelosi step aside and let the Democratic Party transform itself with a new vision and new leadership, the better!!\\n', u\"\\nThe Tea Party couldn't have emerged if Koch brothers hadn't designed it and funded its activities in support of climate change deniers and big oil interests.\\n\", u\"\\nThe Electoral votes aligned perfectly with the direct votes in each of the states. That's exactly how it is set up to work.\\n\", u\"\\nThe point of the electoral college is to apportion power among the states so that huge states like California, New York and Florida can't dominate the country--small states like Wyoming and West Virginia have some power, too, and feel included. That's also why each state has two senators, so that Delaware (smaller than many counties in California) has an equal voice in legislation. It avoids destabilizing and national fracturing like Brexit--although a Brexit-like breakup was tried here in 1860. Some people are still unhappy that it didn't work.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nI seem to remember that a certain nan called Niccolo Machiavelli said that it is far better to be feared than loved.\\n\\nAnd just by reading that you felt obliged to make this nan your personal guru? I didn't. \\n\\nOften those who want to be loved do so because they care too much about their legacies.\\n\\nI'm not sure what you're addressing this to me for - I've never given a shit about being loved (I think my comment history amply reflects that), and more importantly, it isn't as if the only alternative to Machiavellianism is to be needy or ego-driven. I'm not going to bother reading any further comments from you because even by the rather low standards here at the moment they're extraordinarily shallow. And, strangely, grandiose. I will add, though, that I think you're wrong about humanity fearing extinction as well, particularly in this context. All evidence is to the contrary. Most Americans in particular are very religious and believe in an afterlife. I've long suspected it's a key part of why they deny climate change ought to be a serious concern - they think life on this planet is simply a waiting period before the real deal begins.\\n\", u\"\\nSo what you are saying is, you want your politicians to tell you what you want to hear, even though they know that they can't achieve that. That what you want?\\nThat exactly why Trump was elected. He told people what they wanted to hear, but, there is no way for him to deliver on that because his tax policies and business policies don't add up to what he has said. Example: He said he will create 25 million jobs during his administration, 8 years I assume.\\nThe past 5 republican presidents combined haven't created that many jobs, so how is Trump going to do it. It's simply not achievable, but it got him votes didn't it.\\n\", u\"\\nInstead we'd be in a different mess, with corrupt, uncaring politicians continuing to ignore the suffering among America's working poor.\\nTrump's revealing himself to be a poor President, but that doesn't mean we have to pretend the other option was palatable.\\n\", u\"\\nBeing an uncompromising Berniecrat, or a single-issue zealot, plays right into the hands of Republicans and our wealthy masters since it ensures that the left will remain divided. To avoid Trump-like tyrants, one must be willing to hold one's nose and vote for someone less than perfect. In the cases of Al Gore and Clinton, I saw people who had dedicated their lives to public service, but not necessarily people who agreed with my ideals. I'll take someone like that over a Trump any day.\\n\", u'\\nThat view is incorrect.

That was two votes for Trump. They're now sorry. I wonder if this guy is actually a Republican troll sent to splinter the opposition. If purists who voted for Jill Stein and Bob the Pothead in Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin had voted for Clinton, we wouldn't be in this mess.\\n\", u'\\nThe main thing we can learn from the Tea Party is how to take over (I would say, rather, take back) the Democratic party: their methods of gaining a large measure of control over the Republican party worked quite well.\\n', u'\\nYou really should not have opted for the lobotomy, then you would have seen that Trumps campaign with the 6 x thickness US Flags is a throw back to Leni Riefenstahl and \"Triumph of the Will\" .

At least I don't mean to do that and I understand what you are saying, but those who didn't vote for Hillary (voted for Stein) screwed themselves and us. But yet, I hear many of them trying to lap dog off the blame to the Dem's or the DNC. Sure they were disappointed, so was I, but I didn't stick my head in the sand and they did.\\nIt wasn't a very smart choice for them to choose between Stein or Hillary, because that risked getting Trump. Which they now have. The smart choice was to vote Hillary in 2016 and immediately get their candidate ready for 2020.\\nThere was ZERO risk in doing that, that's why when to try and push the blame elsewhere, I will call them out on that. Elections do have consequences.\\n\", u'\\nYou really think the Democrats don\\'t have enough \"cynical political insiders?\" Please. That is partly what got them into trouble in the first place. And their leaders still don\\'t seem to get it.\\n', u\"\\nAgreed.There was nothing more sickening than admiring so much about the Women's Marches only to have to look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz slithering as closely as she could toward the microphones and cameras. That momentary image said a lot.\\n\", u'\\nIt is a representative republic. Nobody claims it to be a pure democracy.\\n', u'\\nI think you need to look at your democracy. In most democratic Countries the peoples collective direct votes count. In America you have some half assed system where you vote delegates on some arcane system few people understand and you get a narcissist who poles 3 million less in the popular vote and gets to frustrate the will of the American people ,Vladimir Putin can only look on in envy, Robert Mugabe may introduce it for his next re-election and China are certainly looking at it not to mention Saudi Arabia and North Korea.\\n', u\"\\n> Do you really believe Republicans would have ever voted for that?? Maternity leave. It one thing to propose something but quite another to get it enacted into law.\\nNo, I don't believe they would've voted for it. But if it was proposed Dems would've signaled that they were willing to fight for it and might've gotten enough votes in the next election. Politics is a long term chess game. Well, when it is done right. First an awareness of an issue needs to be raised, then support needs to be built up, then finally people come to accept and agree with the proposal 5-10 years down the road.If social issues are never raised , they will never be resolved.\\nSo, again, it shows quite clearly that Democrats are not even willing to pursue social policies long term.\\n\", u\"\\nI don't particularly like establishment Democrats either, but I'd be very careful assuming that you can beat Trump with just the progressive wing of the Democratic party/electorate behind you.\\n\", u'\\nEXACTLY, it is in the interest of the corporate money pigs in the Democratic establishment to contiue business as usual, who cares about losing elections when donor money is on offer.

If they stand UP and bring light to the choices, that alone is a victory.\\n\", u\"\\n\\n... the Sanders left and its allies are the only force in the US that have the ideas that can win an immediate majority in this country: a class-based movement for jobs and justice. That vision must triumph over not just Trump, but the Democratic leadership.\\n\\nI supported Bernie Sanders, but to think (a) that Sanders' side of the party is sufficient in numbers and strength to defeat Trumpism and (b) that Americans will respond to a 'class-based' movement in doing so is a fantasy. \\nSanders got all of 13 million votes in last year's Democratic primaries; that's just 43% of the total. Clinton got over 65 million in the general election -- beating Trump by nearly three million -- and even that plurality wasn't enough to win.\\nA little reality would do us all some good. We're going to need every dog in this fight. Let's not start tearing ourselves apart into factions before we've even taken on that orange-haired bully.\\n\", u'\\nWell, get started today. Build a progressive party. What are you waiting for?\\n', u\"\\nDon't be so naive. Do you really believe Republicans would have ever voted for that?? Maternity leave. It one thing to propose something but quite another to get it enacted into law. I am quite sure if Obama believed he had a snowballs chance in hell of getting that passed, it is the first thing he would have done.\\nPresidents propose and congress disposes. You never heard of that? The party in control of congress sets the real agenda, not the President.\\n\", u'\\nThe way you fight ideology is in publicized fair and open debates, where we discuss the issues, without name calling.\\n', u'\\nThe popular vote within each state determines who votes in the Electorsl College representing that state. How would you gerrymander a statewide vote?\\n', u\"\\nWhich Knight shall we follow? It's a debate that occurs every time there's a defeat (electoral distortions aside).\\nBack in the '72 Election, there was a champion called McGovern. The reasons why his campaign crashed were hotly debated for a very long time. Reading Fear & Loathing on the Campaign Trail it's obvious that there was a split between pragmatists and idealists that played out at the DNC in a numbers game. The result seems to have pleased nobody; there was a pragmatic campaign headed by an idealist. It looked phony whether you were one or the other.\\nThe Presidential campaign would have been a disaster without CREEP or Eagleton. And so it was. A wipe-out.\\nThis time what's required is definitely new blood without a long and vulnerable record and some robust, defensible principles who's willing to stand by them but also willing to make necessary compromises and explain them to the satisfaction of activists and voters.\\nAlso, the organisation needs to be overhauled and modernised. Bannon's use of voters' profiles, for example, clearly battered the Party in unanticipated ways. We need to know how it was done and what needs to change to meet the challenge. I suspect that Trump's unusual campaign itinerary was driven by these new approaches.\\nThe issues of voter registration suppression and gerrymandering are fundamental to any success. It's nuts and bolts stuff; it's campaign time now for 2018.....\\n\", u\"\\nThat would make sense if the Democrats in the Senate had offered sincere, united opposition to the worst excesses of the new administration. Strongly worded press releases and candlelight vigils are great and all but what does it say when you can't even bring yourself to vote against the confirmation of his cabinet of horrors? \\nSupposed liberal heroes like Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown voted to advance Ben Carson's nomination based on the weakest of guarantees. Multiple Democrats have indicated a willingness to vote to confirm Wilbur Ross, Mnuchin & Tom Price. All these nominees are completely at odds with their own stated values and you would have us waste our energy on lining up behind this flim flam opposition?!\\n\", u\"\\nExactly. It is pretty strange to see Americans and many other being shocked by the election of Trump. Isn't he the pinnacle of what the US stood for years - hubris, arrogance, might makes it right, the biggest, the best, the #1 ?It is like these people were living in some alternative reality and now suddenly woke up.\\n\", u'\\nProtests without leadership gave us Occupy, which raised awareness that people wandering around accomplish essentially nothing.\\n', u'\\nSorry, gerrymandering DOES affect presidential races, because it affects the makeup of the electoral college.\\n', u'\\nHillary, of course, wasn\\'t the best one they had. But the Dem establishment told everyone else not to run because it was \"Hillary\\'s turn\".\\n', u\"\\nCan't you people/bots come up with something better than the Trump as Hitler routine?\\n\", u\"\\nAnd if Clinton wasn't pathologically secretive and double faced she would've been in the White house too. Except she wouldn't have been the same person, probably would've divorced Bill a long time ago and never had a shot at the White House.\\nAnd here you have it - the system as it stands now is primed for corruption.\\n\", u'\\nThe Writer Frances Wheen in 2004 wrote a brilliant book which looking from the viewpoint of 1979 (an historical hinge year) compared amongst other things the coinciding of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan coming to Power in the West and the coming to Power of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, he called this book\" How Mumbo- Jumbo Conquered the World.

Protests without leadership lead to nothing. Well, maybe to some chaos and disillusionment. Democrats lack leaders, people with vision who have the guts to stand up for what they believe in. Democrats on the top are all technocrats of Clinton\\'s school. They have no conviction, only love for power.\\nDemocrats need leaders who are able to articulate their future vision. I commented a long time ago that for all nice talk it was very telling that Obama in all his 8 years never even brought up lack of maternity leave in the US. Clinton made some generic promises that she was going to \"support women\" but she wasn\\'t believable because of her previous actions.\\n', u\"\\ngood article and I couldn't agree more that waiting for establishment Democrats - the most useless self serving bunch that ever existed - is useless\\n\", u'\\nThe DNC and the Permanent Campaign have provided a very comfortable lifestyle for the upper echelon of Democrats in office along with their P AC and campaign staffs. They cannot be expected to do anything that will interrupt the cash flow that enables them to live like billionaires on campaign expense accounts. Woodward at the Times pointed out that CGI spent $50 million on luxury jet travel, not counting shared or comped flights from those with businesses with government connections. Momentum must start in a Gulfstream V.\\n', u\"\\nSeveral weeks ago, I would've agreed with the premise. But lately I've been seeing signs of a spine in the Democratic Party.When they choose a DNC, we'll know a lot.\\n\", u'\\nPerhaps: but not a single such person expressed interest in the job in the recent election cycle. Similarly, it took 30 years of constant attacks to take down Clinton, combined with significant foreign interference, law breaking by a major intelligence agency, etc.\\nThis was hardly the mammoth loss anti-establishment forces wish it was.\\n', u\"\\nThe heading is so true. Don't forget that 13 establishment Dems voted AGAINST allowing us to buy cheaper prescriptions from Canada, such as Corker and Booker. A LOUD boo to them.\\n\", u\"\\nOh, he said it. There was a bit more context around it, but the gist was that a woman stood up and asked about how to get people elected, and his very first thought was to lecture her about identity politics, and why they should be abandoned. Having just been beaten by a female politician, his first response was to tell a latina woman that she shouldn't try to get latin Americans, or women, into government.\\nAlso, as a reminder: Clinton did NOT focus on her gender as a reason to elect her. People love to lie about that, but she did NOT run on 'being a woman'. She ran on being pro-women, certainly. She was also pro-children, and pro-environment, but didn't claim to be either 12 years old or a Redwood. Now, the reasons people loved to HATE her certainly seem to come down to her gender - it's the only characteristic that sufficiently explains the insane opposition to her, but that was never a reason she used for why she should be elected.\\n\", u\"\\nYou seem very confused. Obamacare under the tender mercies of the insurance industry rather than universal and affordable health care is what people want? Really? War in 7 Islamic countries is what people want? Really? Fractured civil liberties via indiscriminate surveillance and draconian 'Homeland Security' measures is what people want? Really? Trade agreements that send jobs abroad and hamstring environmental and safety regulations are what people want? Really? Neoliberal 'austerity' policy that destroys safety nets and leaves the wealthy untouched is what people want? Really?\\nGovernance by the DLC/ThirdWay/NewDemocrat establishment has perpetuated and in several cases initiated all of those, and many more things that people really don't want - only in social 'wedge issues' which don't inconvenience its corporate masters has it been anything like what mainstream America wants. And as for youth, not only are they at the forefront of the consequences of these joint efforts of the Democratic and Republican establishments to turn our society into a feudal one (hence considerably MORE knowledgeable in that area than their elders are) but they've had less time to be brainwashed by the soothing drone of the Democratic establishment's pretense of being a 'lesser evil' than their elders have (and less party-membership inertia to overcome as well).\\nHillary had more popular support than Trump? Well, if you want to consider a 2.4% edge in the popular vote significant, I guess. And it might be more accurate to say that Hillary was (only marginally) less unpopular than Trump: exit polling indicated that roughly 1/3 of Hillary's votes were primarily anti-Trump votes and 1/3 of Trump's votes were primarily anti-Hillary votes.\\nBy (very stark) contrast, polling has consistently indicated that most of Bernie's policy positions had majority public support, so rather than being extreme (in anything but an inside-the-beltway-bubble sense) he was right smack dab in the American center. And that (plus the refreshing novelty of having someone free to speak his, and their, mind) is why people across the entire political spectrum flocked to him.\\n\", u'\\nYour contempt is not a marketable political trait. Whether you see it as correct or not, many others will simply see you as somebody to be avoided at all costs.\\n', u'\\nNow you know how half the country felt when Obama was elected.\\n', u'\\nI agree that Trump et al are probably a catalyst but there again Adolf was pretty Catalytic.\\n', u\"\\nBecause it was reported on, in reliable media. And, just for example: can you say 'environmental racism'? When he needed to find a place to store radioactive waste from VT nuclear power, he found it - hispanic communities in Texas. He didn't just agree with the plan, he co-sponsored it - he was one of the people who pushed it through.\\nThat's just one of the many attacks the GOP had ready to go. And given that a democratic candidate needs, desperately, the support of minorities... one can imagine that this actual true thing that he actually proudly did would hurt him a fair bit.\\n\", u'\\nThe last US election can be described as: When Turds Collide!\\n', u\"\\nMy thoughts exactly. It must be more than an anti-Trump movement, and it must move people forward to a different vision of society, not a return to the Clinton and Obama years. In this sense, Trump's election provides the left with an opportunity to regain the momentum it has lost over the last several decades.\\n\", u\"\\nMost of my Republican friends ditched their party too.. the final straw was GW Bush and the sell out to the 'christian right'.. the only way to gain representative gov't would be to remove all external funding .. that seems very remote possibility at this juncture..\\n\", u\"\\nWe have a winner!\\nWe had a Republican nominee who brought in new voters and a Democratic nominee who only played well with 55 + blue state Dems.\\nI said it here and then -- the race was lost the moment the Dems sabotaged Sanders.\\nThe next race will be fought on the same grounds -- who can bring in new voters, who inspires the young.\\nSpoiler -- it's not Biden, Booker or any other DLC idiots.\\n\", u'\\nI would say that the Democratic Party defeated itself by first marginalizing its liberal base back in the Bill Clinton years and then not making a home for the progressive left in 2016. \\nIt has been Republican-lite for two long.

No comparison between Trump and Hillary Clinton. She's mentally fit and qualified to be POTUS. Trump is well - certifiable. And I don't give a tinker's fart whether or not he has good intentions as far as bringing jobs to the US. As the saying goes, the path to hell is paved with good intentions. Trump and Bannon the de factor POTUS are truly frightening. They will end up burning down the house with everyone in it, except themselves. They'll walk away with their millions and not face the blowback of their actions. The other 99% won't be so lucky. Thanks to the conservative members of the Supreme Court who ruled if favor of Citizens United we now have unlimited campaign contributions from guys like the Koch brothers who spent over 200 million in this last election. In the next election they will pony up around 400 million in order to buy more legislators to implement their corrupt and damaging agenda. I agree about vested interests. They have no place in government, but to even compared a nut case like Trump with a qualified (if somewhat flawed...ain't we all?) candidate like Hillary Clinton is laughable.\\n\", u\"\\nNixon was far to the left of any present day Dem.

Problem is that she did not have a clue what American women were all about, as evidenced by the number of unkept women who voted for Trump, and as evidenced by that women's march which proudly displayed visible minorities et al in pink pussy hats and no singular focus on western women issues at all. Hell.. if you could make a sign about any little thing (whether true or untrue) that might discredit Trump.. then you were invited to join the march.

The fact you see only black and white and insist on being not only right but smarter than people who disagree with you is exactly what the Trump camp needs. Yeah, there's a lot of drivel\\u2014but the truth IS more nuanced. Is Trump's ascendancy an American tragedy? Absolutely. But he won because a lot of people's needs and aspirations went unaddressed for decades. Is Brexit idiotic (and does it have a racial component)? Absolutely.

Does this not suggest that something was wrong with Hillary as a candidate? Voters rejected her because she too obviously represented the big bankers and others of the oligarchic class. Keep running that sort of candidate and you keep allowing people as horrid as Donald Trump to win.\\n', u'\\nExcept that climate change is about nothing if not survival.

I value respect for the law, and intellectual honesty, but I also know that sometimes you have to be cynic and manipulative to navigate these waters, specially because the right is not big on intellectual honesty and facts, so trying to convince them with arguments does not work. It is like trying to defend the teaching of evolution from creationists, you will not convince them, so you will have to outsmart them, and force it on them. Question?

We have to stop treating politics as a game in which our side needs to win; a politics of exclusion on the left won\\'t be any better than one on the right. It is precisely because of exclusion that many people (including yourself apparently) were manipulated into believing Clinton was a poor candidate. Your whole theory falls apart when you realize that Clinton did SIGNIFICANTLY better than Sanders, and that his support came from the youth, which by definition means they would have had less time to acquire the knowledge to properly assess policy (it DOESN\\'T make sense for a rural minimum wage worker in Louisiana to make $15 per hour regardless of how good \"more money\" sounds in the abstract). Surely democrats should strive to be more inclusive, but moving more extreme to achieve this end flies in the face of every accepted theory of politics as well as common sense. Hillary had more popular support than Trump as well. I know everyone wants to react but your cure is worse than your disease.\\n', u\"\\nThe entire party is not corrupt.

If not in the Democratic Party, it will be necessary to build a progressive party from scratch. That will take a lot longer. But taking over the Democratic Party will mean removing most of the neoliberal neocons in the party, which will probably drive away voters who support unbridled big business, Wall Street, and American Empire. And in this era of ceaseless propaganda, a progressive party will need alternative sources in the news media. Not CNN or MSNBC or any of the other sources of TV news.

The Democratic Party move to the right (Third Way, GOP Lite) has been a resounding failure. Agreeing with the GOP on War, Economics, Taxes, and Budget, has squandered all the good news about demographics favoring the Dems now and in the future. It was directly responsible for so many blue collar workers (once a Dem. base) voting for Trump, and so many other voters staying home. A good example of this insane strategy was the advice proffered by Dem. Sen. Schumer, \"don\\'t worry about losing the blue collar vote in Pennsylvania, as for every one you lose, you\\'ll pick up two GOP votes in the suburbs. And you can repeat this in Michigan,\" etc, etc. Bad policy, bad analysis, and bad math, yet this advocate for GOP Lite is still a leader of the party. A two bit con from NYC has battered this philosophy senseless, it must not be resurrected.\\n', u'\\nOH I agree! Half the reason Trump won was the fact the Democrats have functionally become faux liberals, and in actuality might as well be Republican-lite. Not only that, but real leftists such as Sanders were mocked and sidelined by the DNC. Finally, the focus on identity politics and derision of socio-economic class issues, which include low and middle income whites, pushed away a lot of traditional left allies.\\nBut of course, if I bring that up in my democrat circles, it is heresy.\\n', u'\\nit was shown by the republicans when they used repeal Obama care 6o times and never let the president try to pass bills like building roads and bridges , they used tax payers dollars carelessly .........now as we watch them sit back and say and do nothing to stop trumps carelessness as he brings our rights down, this should tell Americans who to vote for in 2018 for in congress and the house and senate seats...........democrats are helping to fight for the Americans rights the gop is letting treason take hold\\n', u\"\\nDidn't lot sof those people vote for Obama previously?\\n\", u\"\\nThat's a good one.

Every time the party lost, their solution has been to go farther to the right. They drove out their base, and they've destroyed the party. They've lost over a thousand legislative seats in the last 8 years. They lost the White House, the Senate, and the House. They lost 12 governorships. They lost 27 state legislative houses. They backed the only person who could possibly have lost to Trump.\\nMore of the same is the dumbest suggestion I've ever heard.\\n\", u\"\\nYou know, yesterday I was low on gas in my brand new $45,000 pickup so I pulled into a gas station to fill up. Problem was I didn't like the brand of gas they had so I just filled the tank with water. I'll let you know how that worked out.\\nThat's exactly what those who couldn't vote for Hillary did. So now that you have Trump, how it that working out for you? Please let us know.\\n\", u\"\\nThe Democrats won the popular vote decisively. Throwing out half of the party is not going to make things better. The answer is more, earlier and even better efforts in battleground and near-battleground states to overcome the electoral college problem. The worst thing we can do is descend into infighting.Again, it was the electoral college, not the popular vote put Trump in power. Hillary won the Black working class vote. Hillary won the Latino working class vote. It was the White working class vote which was pivotal. To get that, you don't go radical left. You abandon gun control (which Bernie did), abortion rights, and racial equality. I don't want to go there, but bear in mind that ditching the moderate Democrats removes the multimillion vote margin by which Hillary won the popular vote.\\n\", u\"\\nYour observations are self-serving. There were more Democrats voting, out of the small turnout. More people equals more wealth. Also, obviously, wealth is concentrated in metropolitan, rather than rural, areas. D'oh!\\n\", u\"\\nI don't hold hope for the Democratic Party leadership rising to the challenge of the moment. There are good Dem candidates in smaller roles throughout the states that deserve our support in 2018, and hopefully we will see some viable third-party candidates for these seats as well. While it seems like sense to put all your hopes on the established form already existing, that's what got us into this mess in the first place. The present Dem Party won't reform; it will be replaced by new blood coming into the Party.\\n\", u\"\\nOH really? The difference is Obama got advice and Trump didn't. Surely you have more than that because you know well that Trump is getting advice too, just not from the same people Obama did. Policies are not that much different at all.

You aren't going to combat the Trump phenomenon by going farther to the left. You need to relate to conservative people who have American values, but who might differ with you on things like abortion, big government social programs, and taxing the crap out of people. They too are disturbed with what Trump is doing because it violates the Constitution.

Mr. Obama deported more people than all previous administrations combined, and no-one said peep about it, but Mr. Trump is so blatantly horrid that millions hit the streets in protest in his first week. The Democrats are pretty much equally horrid in all but style. Resistance cannot be limited to resisting the Trump Republicans. The DNC Democrats are equally ruinous. But not fooled that we would be better off under Hillary Clinton.

There are surveys that show Americans are progressive when they are questioned on policy and programs, not party affiliation. Steve Bannon asserts that Americans are majority Conservative, but if that were the case why does the last election say something different from the electoral college result even with low voter participation? Why do Republicans have to gerrymander the hell out of the countryside to conquer Congress? Why do they maneuver to repress voter registration? Corporate employees are illegally persuaded to make donations to the Republican Party, sometimes recompensed by their annual bonuses.

Using them as the scapegoat is the equivalent of burying your head in the sand. The establishment wing of the democratic party is FAR more to blame for the situation we are in because their apathy, complicity and yes corruption has led us into a set of circumstances where people are no longer excited to vote for democrats or democratic policy. Rather they are voting against republicans and republican policy. Again, that\\'s not what helps voter turnout. And voter turnout is what helps Democrats.\\nThe best recent example of the failure is of the democratic establishment, is the day after the completely unprecedented women\\'s march which while centered on women was a general rebuke of Trump, here is Chuck Schumer talking about their strategy of finding ways to work with Trump (which would necessitate them confirming his ridiculously unqualified and dangerous cabinet appointments before even seeing if they could get anything out of him). You just watched the biggest ever demonstration against one person and your answer is to give him what he wants on the HOPE that you can get a few concessions? \\nThat is the democratic establishment in a nutshell. That is why people don\\'t believe in them. That is why they didn\\'t come out and vote for Hillary. That is why they couldn\\'t win back the Senate.

That is, it is a democratic nation, but not a socially-democratic one. What\\'s the difference?\\nThat question is answered by the definition of a Social Democracy, which is this (from WikiP): \"Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy, and a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy, measures for income redistribution, and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions.\"\\nSocial Democracy IS NOT Socialism - because the latter is based upon government ownership of the means of production. A social-democracy is able to function properly in a capitalist market-economy. Because capitalism is not an \"ideology\", but a \"mechanism\" - one that, for the exchange of goods/services, we employ money instead of barter. \\nThe keystone attributes of a Social Democracy are a political outlook that implements two key social-services:*A free (or nearly free) National Health Service (perhaps the reason why Europeans have life-spans three years more than we Yanks), and *Nearly free Postsecondary Education.

By every measure Trump is to the left of Hillary Clinton. \\nI didn't vote for either and am very glad that Hillary Clinton is not the president.

Incinerating the planet just to make a point is bad for business.Clinton's danger was her neo-conservatism, the JFK-like aggressiveness in foreign policy (especially in the third world), an over-eagerness to be confrontational without any plausible reason to be.

There are also states were illegal voting is extremely easy - a simple fact there are three groups in US: citizens, legal residents, and illegal immigrants. The legal citizen group has most rights of citizens, but no right to vote. There are 30 million legal residents.

If Big Money, Party Support or Favourable Media actually won elections, we wouldn't be having this discussion in the first place. Whether you want to pin this on the celebrity factor or on something else, the truth remains that Trump conquered the masses who attended his rallies long before he even became acceptable on the more traditional electoral factors (i.e. the party apparatus, mainstream media punditry or Big Money sponsors).

I supported Hillary but I don't blame the left. Few sulked all the way to the ballot box. Certainly Bernie himself became a loyal soldier. \\nDivision and recrimination is insane.

He got screwed by the DNC and Corporate Media that was in the bag for Hillary. Should he have sued? Nothing would have changed. Once his chances of being on the ballot were over, he chose the most pragmatic path for America, which was Hillary. My complaint with Bernie was not doing more for downballot candidates with like-minded ideas like Tim Canova. But backing Hillary was no kind of sellout at all.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump will say anything to get elected but as the first 10 days have shown, he follow through on those promises. - build the wall, bring back jobs, control illegal immigration and legal immigration, Seems the union leaders are now understanding why so many of their workers agree with Trump's plans and policies that actually help businesses rather than just taxing businesses and giving the money to others.\\n\", u'\\nIs that so?

If the problem was only Hillary, why do you think the gop controls the house, senate, pres, governors, state legislature? Glad to see the left still has no clue what the American people are saying and will continue this path toward oblivion. It really makes it much easier, and cheaper, for the gop to continue winning.\\n', u'\\nIt was stupid enough to pretend that Hillary and Trump were the same before the election. But surely only a deliberate liar would claim that now. So you\\'re saying that if Hillary had been elected, things would be pretty much like they are right now, ten days into the Trumpreich?I believe the technical term for that claim is \"lying\".\\n', u'\\nMost US-Anericans don\\'t even know what a socialdemocratic policy looks like. What they call left is right of centre and what they call liberal is deregulated economy with and divisive identity politics. Ironically, this thinking has been imposed on and ingrained into them by the very same elites they now think is the answer to Trump: the Democrat Party establishment and the \"leftwing\" MSM: looking into alternative Social or political ideologies made you a communist or a unpatriotic traitor. The masses of Americans haben been played by their elites since the Foundation of the State. Now we see a struggle of an infringed elite, represented by Trump and some oil- and banking moguls and peripheral neocons, against the prevalent elites of Clinton, Obama and most of the republicans and democrats. They do the bidding of a Silicon Valley/Wall Street elite in leauge with most of the intelligence agencies and most Corporate media and academic and celebrity/entertainment figures. The latter being played into serving their purposes by being allowed to a status of Self-absorbed ciltural vanguard/elite. They promote and foster social division that way, implementing identity politics ( divide and rule).How they can be whipped into a frenzy we see these days. Trump\\'s immigration decrete is a relatively minor abberation of traditional \"western values\"- politics and if you read the Guardian and the like or listen to deluded west-coast students or celebrities you\\'d think a fascist Coup is imminent. Compare that to crass unlawful, inhumane actions of Obama and Clinton, like extra-judicial drone-killings and illegal mass- surveillance - real breaches of the Constitution and real threats to freedom and the rule of law and compare the reactions of the media and urban, coastal \"liberals\". They are just puppets being played against Trump by the other elite-faction. And, most sickeningly, only does they not realize it, no, they feel morally and intellectualy superior\\n', u'\\nTrump is bad - is the overriding editorial policy of the Guardian and all the liberal media here in Europe and in the US. I doubt we will see any articles expressing either a neutral or a positive view of anything Trump says or does.\\n', u'\\n\\nOur response in the labor movement must be to support rank-and-file struggles against leaders prone to conciliation for even the most meager of concessions. We must demand the same accountability from liberal organizations and the Democratic party, as well. There is no doubt that this stance will put like-minded leftists and liberals in direct confrontation with establishment Democrats and their assorted lackies.\\n\\nThere is even less of a doubt said stance will put \"like-minded leftists and liberals in direct confrontation with\" those leftists in- and outside of the Democrats who, with Sanders at the helm, have been promoting economic protectionism and isolationism for years now, doing their fair share of paving the way for Trump -- i.e. the very people the author is promoting as the ones to follow in the struggle.\\nThis whole article is based upon the supposition of a simple binary opposition: evil bosses (and their treasonous lackey, the union and party establishment) versus \"the people,\" always pure and good and automatically on the right, i.e. left side of things (and when they vote in a racist demagogue, it is just out of desperation no true socialist was running). But isn\\'t it far more plausible that a union leader praising his meeting with Trump isn\\'t doing it to sell out the rank-and-file -- but in an attempt to appeal to his members? We know that Trump pulled many unionized voters in the Rust Belt states. We know that, in 1968 and 1972, George Wallace had huge support among rank-and-file union members. Historically, fascism has always held a popular appeal for \"the common people\" -- it didn\\'t particularly benefit them economically, but it allowed them to make those less fortunate than them suffer even more.\\nThe people can hate \"the establishment\" for many different reasons -- because it\\'s too authoritarian or too little authoritarian, because it grinds the workers into the dust or because it doesn\\'t do enough to grind minorities into the dust. If the anti-Trump movement is to succeed, this is the first lesson to keep in mind. The struggle won\\'t be won because the white working class is just waiting for a \"true\" champion against \"the establishment,\" and even less so by making concessions to popular resentments. If it is to succeed, then by standing firm for reason and civilization. And if the enlightened wing of the ruling class (aka the \"Democratic establishment\") is willing to participate in that, I\\'d be more than happy to see them do it.\\n', u'\\nComing from you, this is rather rich.\\n', u'\\nobsolutely, and don\\'t forget while you and I are struggling to get a job and pay the bills, the left will concentrate on how to destroy businesses in the name of \"climate control\".\\n', u\"\\nYou are absolutely ri/ correct, DT is not a force to be reckoned with but a symptom to be recognised and cured. Income disparity has created this problem and higher taxes on those who benefit from a nation's workforce is a big part of the answer.

Cutting taxes and borrowing more money will be a real, not a trumpish Disaster.\\n\", u\"\\nUtter nonsense!\\nThis is the kind of dangerous talk that actually had led the United States to this point. People like Bhaskar Sunkara were bashing Hillary Clinton at every opportunity, creating this false equivalency between a competent woman and a dangerous, misogynistic psychopath.\\nPeople like Sunkara have put Trump in the White House! The votes of the far left could have ended Trump's chances of winning the electoral college. Instead they helped him.\\nWhat people like Sunkara (and Owen Jones on this side of the Atlantic) don't realize, is that most Americans never have been and never will be of the Far Left disposition. That's a pipe dream. But to further this pipe dream, the tragedy is that they have allowed the United States to fall into the hands of a man of the Far Right disposition instead. And now we have a Muslim ban. That would never have happened under Hillary.\\nEstablishment Republicans have indeed let their country down, to my intense disappointment. Establishment Democrats have not, however.\\nThe Far Left can grow up, or they can go away. Their culpability in the election of Donald J Trump as POTUS is immense.\\n\", u'\\nMy God, listening to you people talk, no-one would ever know the other side got more votes. Such arrogance. \\nReal change is about moving forward. Not back to the 1930s. Every idea Trump proposes has already been tried countless times, with disastrous results. \\nListening to you guys, aliens might be forgiven for thinking protectionism and nationalism were brilliant new ideas. Apparently they are, to you.\\n', u'\\nThe only chance to beat Trump is TO UNITE!!! All 54.1% who voted against Trump should focus on one and one thing how to stop him democratically. The division and staring in-fighting to remove \"establishment\" is a recipe for disaster and Trump will win. DIVISION AND CONCUR was the motto for divisive people like Hitler, like Khomeini, Ghadafi and now Trump... It would be illogical, unwise and simple stupid to divide the progressive left of the centre, centrist, liberal moderate left and far left. Let\\'s be SMART - LET\"S UNITE in an inclusive movement AGAINST TRUMP... RESISTANCE AGAINST TRUMP - all of us together!\\n', u'\\nwow, another example of just how out of touch the leftists are. They complain that the union leaders want to work with Trump saying the union workers must rise up. They do not even have a clue that it was the workers that rose up against the leaders in the last election to leave the Dnc that has destroyed their jobs and salaries the last 8 yrs. Yes, please, continue to move farther left all the way to socialism. The majority of voters do not want to pay for someone else\\'s college so they can get a useless degree and then we can pay for their healthcare and all living expenses so they can \"follow their dreams\". You leftists are just making it to easy for the gop to continue gaining seats in the house, senate, governors, state legislatures. Please, continue to help us out so we do not have to spend money campaigning.\\n', u'\\nSorry Bhaskar but you are talking complete and utter rubbish. Dangerous, naive rubbish. The fracturing of the left has always been a gift to the right (who do not usually share our ideological qualms when it comes to seizing and maintaining power) - the bitter enmity between the KPD and the SPD was a key factor in the rise of Nazism, for example. \\nI would have voted for Bernie in the primaries were I entitled to do so, but however much he was cheated, that fight is over. We need solidarity against the common enemy - we can argue about our differences once it is destroyed.\\nIn any case, I would imagine that attitudes towards Trump among establishment Democrats can only have hardened in the last few days, and would strongly suspect that inclinations towards conciliation and compromise are fast disappearing.\\nThat is at least one saving grace about this administration - strategically they are not exactly subtle.\\n', u\"\\nBernie is the kind of Democrat that could have won had he not been derailed by the Democrats that ended up putting Trump in office. Half the votes for Trump were actually anti-Clinton votes. I hope you didn't get milk all over your pant-suit.\\n\", u\"\\nThe far right wins an election and your solution is that the democrats need to move left in search of an electoral majority? Maybe, but it doesn't sound very plausible. To win the Dems will need to assemble and mobilize a coalition that includes a lot of centre and centre right voters. Something more convincing than the Obama/Clinton approach is needed, but I'm not sure a strong left tilt is going to go anywhere in the USA.\\n\", u'\\nHow many people would vote for a candidate without a policy? The November election showed that the focus has switched to social media and that chucking money into the mainstream no longer works.I was fortunately looking in from the outside. Trump made your election more entertaining than usual. It looked as though most candidates through the preliminaries and all the way to November roughly wanted the same things. Trump was the only one who seemed to say \"This is what I will do\". Both wanted to create jobs. Clinton never said how. Trump said jobs must stay in America and if American companies close and move over the border I will tax their goods. This may only be a small step and nothing close to a solution but at least it was something for the electorate to get their teeth into.The seats will be contested by candidates who 98% of the time want the same thing. The candidate with a plan is the one who will generally win.\\n', u'\\n\"despised gender\"... these misogynists have an ironic streak in their speech like you can\\'t believe it.\\n', u\"\\nwith trumps son in law feeling left out some thing tells me ......if any thing happens , it will come from within the trump WH people it self....................there's just to much going on even for them .the first to go will be spicer, he's just not geared for pressure...........and ever time they all have to talk the opposite of what trump says they'll lose it...............watch this space\\n\", u\"\\nHere's what you actually have to contend with in America...\\nThere are loons ( and not just a few of them ) who actually tie in Trump's name with 'the trumpet shall sound...' and other Biblical references.

The Democrats need their own Corbyn to reinvigorate the party and realign it with working people!\\n', u'\\nGood read: http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/01/27/the-empire-has-no-clothes/\\n', u\"\\nCompletely correct.\\nBut it ain't gonna happen. Corporate establishment democrats understand that by making things about identity politics, no economic concessions are necessary. The liberal establishment media, such as the NYT, WaPo, Guardian, support this agenda. \\nThis is why Cory Booker was recently able to vote against important drugs from Canada ,which would have made them cheaper, as his Big Pharma donations predicted he would. The left complained, but the liberals then criticised the left for complaining \\nYet Cory Booker is the Chosen One of the democrats, and the most likely Presidential contender in 2020.\\n\", u'\\n\"Bernie Democrats\"? I almost spit out my milk. Bernie just pretended to be a Democrat so he would have a snowballs chance in hell of coming even close to winning. No need to continue this little fantasy of Bernie winning.\\n', u'\\nThe left needs to stick to the important stuff.Which toilet can a transgender person use....Can a transgender child be a member of the scouts....

He was deliberately sabotaged by a DNC establishment cabal who had very early on (I'd say aroiund 2008) decided who would be Obama's successor. Clearly, not another specimen of the despised gender was going to be allowed to wreck the Anointed One's campaign, even if his ideas and the chances of winning were actually better and he was actually genuine. Understand, therefore, that it was the politics of identity that lost you an election. Understand also that it is another variety of the same politics of identity holding power at the moment, with potentially disastrous results. Understand, finally, that in order to start winning elections again, a truly progressive movement must coalesce; it will not do that around the concepts of identity politics, which are anything but progressive.\\n\", u'\\nNo. A great mayor once said there is no Democratic or Republican way to clean the streets.\\n', u\"\\nYeah, but I think you have to look at what Bernie did from a wider perspective. By the time he endorsed CorruptHillary, it was a two horse race. Either her, or the mad dog fascist we ended up with.\\nI'd have done exactly the same in his position.\\n\", u'\\nStart you own party then instead of freeloading.\\n', u\"\\nIt's worse than that, the Democrats can't land a finger on Trump. That would require moral authority. They traded that for power years ago. \\nNow they have neither. \\nAmerica has devolved into a place where millions of voters, and it's media, are nothing more than dishonest, hypocritical partisans. \\nNot unsurprisingly people aren't flocking to support dishonest Dems as an alternative to dishonest GOPers.\\n\", u\"\\nYes 100% Dump the Democratic Leadership. They are so out of touch with all voters. Trump would not have beaten Bernie Sanders. Hillary's character and integrity is why she lost to Trump. Transparency in the Democratic Party wins elections.

Lies.\\n\", u'\\nUK Tory - Arse Butter on Steroids\\nTheir policies reek of Class Warfare\\n', u\"\\nChuck Schumer is a joke.

Democrats require charismatic leadership that supports the working classes and these men and women are not all that easy to come up with. A person can make a very good living in the nation'c capitol but not by supporting the working classes. As long as private money can buy legislative seats to fill with corporate lackeys the people are going to see their democracy fade away. We now have a president that has made a fortune out of doing whatever he felt was best for him and letting the courts deal with the complaints.

There is no way on Gods green earth that a party of the far left will ever win power in the U.S. The political centre of gravity is centre right Libertarian and while many progressive policies are popular , Progressives themselves aren't and for good reason, far left politics is currently riven with ideologically driven obsessions about identity that are every bit as divisive and unpopular as anything the tea party is offering up.\\n\", u\"\\nMake America Great Again\\nPut a 98% Tax upon the Oligarchs because : r > g\\nSee Thomas Piketty's, Capital in the 21 Century for why this is necessary for excellent economic reasons.\\n\", u'\\nNo, that navel gazing can be done in parallel, elections are won and legislation passed, as a result of the mechanics described.

They even have the nerve to call themselves left of centre, which is nonsense, in economic terms they are almost as anti worker as the bog standard Victorian mill owner classes.

Some revolution, huh? Learning that Bernie the Sheepdog cared more about electing a corrupt neocon politician than working for the American people as he promised to do was some wakeup call.

Is it right to allow American manufacturers to retrench and move their operations over the border? Should we be spending our money looking after refugees in the first safe country under a UN banner or should we be flying them to America? There are alot more questions to ask but I am sure that you get my drift.\\n', u'\\nthey will eventually.. libs always do even fake libs like the clintons\\n', u'\\nIt would be interesting to know how much the idiot POTUS charged his billionaire friends for a spot at the white house.\\n', u'\\nThat mentality is what got us here in the first place. It holds everybody hostage, and things just get worse. We need a real alternative, not more of the same two parties with the same old politics as usual.\\n', u\"\\nMaybe, but you are forgetting it's 4 years to the next election. The damage Trump will do to progressives in that time, will be more than has been done in the last 40 years. That is not an exaggeration either, read Trumps plans.\\nMake no mistake, Trump is hell bent on his agenda and he well intends to enact it. There will be no real action on climate change and if you never had the opportunity to take a walk in one of our National Parks or Forests, do it now, because within 2 years they are going to be overrun with fracking equipment and mineral mining operations. Trump is going to shred the interior department.\\n\", u'\\nYes, I agree with most of the points this author makes. \\n1) Someone who tells the truth - always.\\n', u\"\\nTrump won because the democratic establishment has lost the confidence of the working people of the US. Sanders would have defeated Trump, but his nomination was blocked by the democratic establishment and the liberal media.Any true progressives and democrats upset about Trump's election need to look to the real causes of this outcome and ask some searching questions about the democratic party.They need to stop falling for the liberal media scapegoats such as blaming Russia. The Trump victory was the failure of the democrats - nothing to do with Russia\\n\", u'\\nYou do understand we live with an Electoral College, right?\\n', u\"\\nTrump is bad and needs to resisted, we all know that. \\nNo, 'we' don't all know that. Clearly you believe him to be bad and in need of being resisted however, don't kid yourself that everyone shares your world view because they most certainly don't.\\n\", u'\\nClinton, seen as the ultimate establishment candidate, just lost to a man who was initially taken about as seriously as the Monster Raving Loony Party. This suggests that less establishment candidates might be a good idea.\\n', u'\\nMore fascist lies\\nhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/donald-trump/why-comparing-trumps-and-obamas-immigration-restri/\\n', u\"\\nBhaskar Sunkara is definitely on to something. This is the beginning of the debate that should have happened ages ago. Trump, as you have been told many times when you would not listen, is the result of the DNC establishment's abject failure in reading the public mood, not just to the Right of them but also to the Left. They doubled down on the only thing they knew: patronage politics based on identity-political groupthink around real or perceived past grievances that were to lead to present entitlements. Too many people told you: 'Sorry. Not buying (any longer).' \\nThe one issue forgotten in all that clamour was of course class. The widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Conman Trump has managed to fool millions of the hard done by (or indeed JAMs) to vote for him. Like Wrexit, nothing of note will be achieved. But fascism has become fashionable again, a phenomenon about which the peddlers of the correct identity politics were warned and elected to ignore. Fascism is white identity politics; it is the entire identity political shedaddle coming full circle. Congratulations, comrades. \\nSo what now? Now that faux progressive politics is dying (thank f*ck) there is room on the left, as Sanders showed. You don't even have to go back to your basic Marx to understand that in the main people's material status informs their decisions. Not always and all the time but much more often than the nefarious concept of 'identity'. \\nSo what's to be done? This: build a movement around bread-and-butter issues, throw in global and environmental concerns if you must and finally understand that telling whole swathes of people that they are sh!t and that their subjectively lived realities do not matter is an election losing strategy. Engage people, don't shout at them. Keep your faux progressive gob shut and listen for a change. And yes, that means that your gargantuan collective ego must take a backseat. That's a price you must be willing to pay. Fail to do this, and you will lose again. And again. And again.\\n\", u\"\\nThe GOP had a 2 foot thick folder of opposition research on Sanders - the majority of it being factually accurate and much more powerful than anything it could bring against Clinton. And this was the stuff they'd done in the off hours just on the slim chance he advanced to the general election.\\nHe MIGHT have won. But the problem with the general election is, everybody gets to be in it. Clinton's major advantage against Trump was her record of actual accomplishment. Sanders would have lost that, given that he and Trump have been about as successful as one another in their chosen careers. We would have been left with two populist demagogues fighting it out, and frankly? Trump is better at that than Sanders is.\\n\", u'\\nAt least the dark side holds power. Real power.\\n', u\"\\n\\nAnd who do you think is funding the anti Trump (and women's) movement\\n\\nThe same entities who brought down Bernie Sanders. They don't care about the Democratic party. They want something else. The Democratic party is useful.\\n\", u\"\\n(I'm writing this as someone who was enthusiastic about Sanders and lukewarm about Clinton.)\\nI fear there is some wishful thinking in the idea that the US electorate was crying out for a social justice platform. Even the Democratic primary voters, faced with that opportunity, failed to take it. It's tempting to think that the divided left would be healed if only the centrist sell-outs were cleared out of the way, but I think those centrists also have a constituency out there among the real voters. \\nClinton was bad at connecting, and she did represent a compromise between liberalism and capitalism that we find highly disappointing. But she did substantively stand on the most left-wing platform for ages. Many of the millions of people who voted against her voted for Trump because they saw her as too left-wing. And I think there were some who voted for Clinton because she was a moderate but would have withheld their support for Sanders. And whoever the Democrats nominate is going to be demonised by the right-wing noise machine. \\nAll I'm saying is that I hope we get more Sanders-type candidates running at every level, and that they push the needle of US discourse to the left. I hope as many as possible are elected to office. But I hope the left doesn't forget the need to put together governing coalitions, which means not treating establishment Democrats as devil worshippers. I'd rather have one of them in charge, and trying to hold on to my vote next time round, than a fascist who would rather take away my vote.\\n\", u'\\nObama never banned refugees. Not from Iraq, not from anywhere else. It never, ever happened. The claim that it did is simply, factually, untrue. Please stop lying about it.\\nAnd want to know what list those 7 countries are on? The list of middle eastern countries which are NOT business partners of Trump.\\n', u'\\nNot according to the constitution.\\n', u'\\nThe 7 countries were on a list compiled by Obama, who also banned Iraqi refugees for 6 months when he was president. The hypocrisy of liberals is, once again, astounding to behold.\\n', u'\\nMeanwhile DM readers believe that the Donald will make them \"great again\". The article makes good statements. We - also us Europeans - will have to face more Trump-like politicians if we do not exercise self-criticism and ask ourselves why such a man could become President. I guess people from all social classes voted for him. I know an American woman who is living here - in Germany - and working as an English teacher. She was very frustrated when she told me that the majority of her family members voted for Trump - all educated people with university degrees.\\n', u'\\nOne of the few good things to come out of the Trump presidency might be the emergence of a genuinely strong, credible and visionary opposition candidate. If the Democrats lazily push forward another pseudo Clinton, I think America (and the rest of the world) could be stuck with Trump for a highly damaging second term.\\n', u\"\\nAs a reminder: Clinton's 'abject failure' required 30 straight years of attacks and lies by the GOP, the media, and the radical left to happen. It required substantial electoral interference by hostile intelligence agencies and foreign powers to happen. Even then, it happened by GAINING seats in both chambers of congress, and by getting 3 million more votes in the general election.\\nThe Clinton platform is the one the majority of people LIKED. The Sanders platform is the one nearly every expert looked at and said 'uh, no, that's a horrible idea'. I get that it gives poorly informed people hope. That they love the words. But well informed people prefer things that will actually improve the world. If you rally around Sanders, and kick out the establishment folks who've actually been improving lives for decades? You basically ensure that you'll not have very many smart people with you.\\nWhich might not matter to you, but smart people DO tend to be the ones who get things right.\\n\", u'\\nAh, use deceit you mean. How cunning.\\n', u'\\nYou do understand that Trump got fewer votes than Clinton, right?\\n', u\"\\nThat's not fair. If you do what you recommend you basically accept the Clinton agenda for the Democrats. This is an agenda based on right wing economics and progressive social policy. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't address the needs of working people, but it lost an election against a very weak candidate.\\nThe writer is saying the left or opposition to Trump should revise what it stands for and gather around a different, more social justice oriented, set of values. I think given the reality on the ground that this is common sense.\\n\", u\"\\nI don't understand this, and replace them with whom? Being a keen political thinker, or just having good intentions isn't enough, politics is hard and requires certain abilities not everybody has, including being able to be diplomatic and not lose it when you see people blatantly lying in front of you. What the US needs is to end the two-party system, because the democratic party is a hodgepodge of neoliberals that do not hate gays and proper socialists (the minority), who in any mature country would not be in the same party.I also wonder, why nobody faces the true cause of this problem? Lack of education and religion.\\n\", u'\\nYou have been bamboozled.\\n', u'\\n\\nA sure way to lose the next round of elections.\\n\\nDefinitely.\\n\\nSo, suck it up buttercups\\n\\nBEST advice anyone has EVER given the Democrats, now or ever.\\n', u\"\\nAnd who do you think is funding the anti Trump (and women's) movement\\n\", u'\\nOf course, they could just ditch the supernatural bollocks entirely.\\n', u\"\\nTo be fair to the man, whenever a white man says 'identity politics need to be ditched' or the like, it's just supporting the idea that white men should be the politicians. Which TOTALLY isn't identity politics, it's just the ordained order of the universe. It's only 'identity politics' when people who AREN'T white men want folks who look and think like them to have political power.\\n\", u\"\\nYou are utterly deluded if you think Trump hasn't got enormous and growing, support from ordinary Americans.\\nThe absurd positions you have taken are seen as pointless and self destructive out in the heartland.\\n\", u\"\\nProbably a few. They thought Clinton was a bad candidate and they didn't want to lend support to a DNC establishment that they felt was dishonest. I'm not saying they were right or wrong, but they voted how they felt and that's what they should have done.\\nPerhaps Trump is a necessary step along a path to a more progressive US.\\n\", u\"\\nBrilliant idea, really. Very Sanders playbook. Speak out against those with a tremendous record of actual progressive achievement, and only allow those with ideas, who've never translated them into success, to be part of your group.\\nI can't see how that could possibly go wrong. Why work with the people who gained seats in both chambers of congress, and who got 3 million more popular votes in the presidential election, when you can tell them how much they all suck, and work against them instead? Why work with the people who've fought for, and won, slow but steady movement on minority rights, minimum wage, and environmental protection when you can instead tell them that it was too little too late, and you prefer people who've never made any progress at all on those fronts to lead them forward?\\nWhy work with accomplished people when you can have professional protesters? Why work with doers when you can have dreamers?\\nWhy make progress? Isn't the point REALLY to be able to just complain endlessly about how horrible Trump is, and never have to take responsibility for anything? It's brilliant - create a group that lacks the experience and talent to actually change things, and you get to be the eternal victim! No worries about ever actually succeeding and having to actually govern.\\n\", u\"\\nYou're right. I find it incredibly disheartening, given the sheer breadth of the opposition to Trump, that so many are already trying to fracture that opposition into the 'left/ right wing', 'anti/pro- establishment', 'anti/pro-Brexit' etc etc.\\nIt's the usual 'Judean People's Front' suspects who are trying to use that opposition to grind their own axes. This is not the time for grinding axes, it's time for everyone to put petty differences to one side and start using them.\\n\", u'\\nIf I understand this article, the anti-trump coalition should fracture into small pieces, rather than stand together against their common enemy?\\n', u\"\\nThe ban is pointless and is likely illegal, if a lot of people support is, it must be the same people that deny climate change. Failure? He has more than half of the country against him in the first week, yes, that's a failure. He has strong critics in his own party, so yes, that's failure. Good luck when you end up giving up your basic freedoms and still end up without jobs and no healthcare.\\n\", u'\\nAt last! A sensible, well reasoned, non-hysterical, anti-Trump article in The Guardian.\\n', u\"\\nI don't think trump will set the progressive agenda back 40 years. There's a strong chance his actions will cause the left to coalesce around a left-leaning populist politician. Someone who will respond to globalisation and rising inequality with policies that address the plight of poor people.\\nIf Clinton had won the left would have become disillusioned, but it's doubtful it would have had the energy to mount a serious challenge to her.\\nYou have to look on the bright side!\\n\", u'\\nDoes anyone really believe that establishment Democrat$ will go down without a fight, even against their own party? They will destroy the Democratic party before they will ever let that happen.\\n', u'\\nThe anti-Trump movement will fail no matter what it does. The fake narratives and ridiculous offense taking will rapidly peter out in the face of all the winning.\\nThe lefty/liberals will need to up their game and try a bit of truthfulness rather than all the spin.\\n', u\"\\nThe RNC would have turned him, an atheist socialist Jew, into the godless commie Elder of Zion in seconds flat if he were the nominee. Middle America still doesn't trust atheists *or* Jews, and they sure as shit don't have the brains to distinguish between socialism and communism. Don't kid yourself: it would have been a minor miracle if Sanders had even taken Vermont.\\nEver notice how Republicans barely laid a glove on him before and during the convention? Sure sign right there that they were salivating to go against him in the general.\\n\", u\"\\nBy all means let us divide our forces in the face of the enemy. You take the gun and I'll take the bullets.\\n\", u\"\\nNo, Sanders is a traitor who helped Trump come to power, with his refusal to accept defeat and his vitriolic campaign against Clinton. If he's the future we are doomed.\\n\", u'\\nDoesn\\'t have a mandate? So, the people who voted Trump in, according to the system in the USA, and the people who voted Leave in the U.K., are somehow disenfranchised by a petulant left. Sorry, but if we\\'re talking \"democracy\" let\\'s get it right.\\n', u\"\\n\\nTrump's failure shows the great value of the established Democrats.\\n\\nThe reality that the establishment Democratic candidate, with more baggage than you'd find in the hold of a 747, actually got more votes than Trump. Unfortunately, the laughable student union activist who wrote this article seems to think this demands more pointless marching and chanting, when in fact it suggests the opposition to Trump needs more cynical political insiders to make sure such a cock-up doesn't happen again.\\n\", u'\\nAgreed, the right would have shredded him.\\n', u\"\\nOh what a brilliant idea! Like when the KPD referred to the SDP as 'social fascists' during the demise of Weimar....That went 'well'...\\n\", u\"\\nInteresting point. I do think the Democratic party has done some progressive things in its history; the new deal and the Great Society and even Obamacare. Also Sanders almost won the nomination; the only reason he didn't (in my humble opinion) is because the people who set teh rules for the competition were in cahoots with Clinton and with the media.\\nSo I wouldn't 100% rule out reforming and re-purposing the Democratic party, although I accept this would be extremely difficult.\\n\", u'\\nYes I agree, I think Corbyn is a man of principal but is not strong enough in his convictions on this scale. Having said that he has a tough, tough job at the minute trying to please a very split party and Nation a like. However getting back to the point ambiguity is his issue and like Trump I think May has been a lot clearer on her stance at the minute.\\n', u'\\n\\ntens of millions of indigenous British people\\n\\nWould those be the pre-Celtic folks who occupied the land before being displaced by the Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and Normans? Not sure if there are still tens of millions of them still around.\\n', u'\\nbernie sanders if he was the democratic candidate would have gotten smoked by trump and lost the popular vote...\\n', u'\\nGo with a man like corbyn he is doing a great job. You can tell he has the establishment scared because they laugh at him. Or something.\\n', u'\\nTulsi Gabbard?\\n(I got a crush on Tulsi Gabbard)\\n', u'\\nYup, which is precisely why there are so many similar problems here in the UK: Same utterly undemocratic voting system leading to major disenfranchisement to the political system and eventually to things like trump/may/brexit...\\n', u'\\n\\nGreen principles and Bernie Sanders\\'s principles have much in common.\\n\\nVery true!They can be summed up well by \"help Trump win\".\\n', u\"\\nTrump won with a smaller share of registered voters than Romney or McCain got. He was not a strong candidate. The fact is that the Clinton message didn't resonate despite the huge support she had from the media, the DNC leadership and her huge marketing budget. She should never have been put forward as the candidate. This is something the Democrats have to absorb as they rebuild.\\nI don't think the anyone-but-Trump approach will work, it's too fragmented and it runs the risk of putting another establishment figure forward, who will lose. They need to get behind a social justice platform and I think the template for this is the Bernie Sanders campaign.\\n\", u'\\nThe Democratic party has always been fractious, they do not have a practical bone in their body. If you lose to Dubya and Trump, who can you beat? The ONLY way forward for Dems, the only hope against the very well organised and focus Repubs is to work hard at winning from the ground up, targetting state and congressional seats with a laser sharp eye, money, organisation, candidates and unrelenting clout to build a majority in Congress and then the Senate. After that, as the absolutely bottom of the barrel Repubs have shown, it doesnt matter much who is President. Time to get organised and get to work. Dems are the majority party in the US but they are their own worst enemy.\\n', u'\\n\"I am extremely left wing in some thinking and right leaning in others.\" You are not alone.\\n', u\"\\nYeah, but we have that too. We had the Tory-Whigs, then Conservative-Liberal (rebranding really), then Labour emerged, so we had Conservative-Labour, but with also Liberals, we had the SNP emerge, the SDP formed, then merged with Liberals to become LibDem. The Greens have a seat, we could see UKIP grow with a few more seats, or we could see the left within Labour lose, then leave, and then patiently grow the Green party as the party of the socialist vote in university towns and inner cities. All this could happen. Okay, this is all just legislature, not executuve, but we've seen Labour, Conservative, Liberal, LibDem in the executive in the last 40 years. Going into the 2015 election, the Tories were playing up the fear of there being SNP within a Labour led coalition. (though Labour said there wouldn't be). But these possibilities were there.\\nWhat is there within the White House? It's Republican or Democrat. And outsideres get in on those tickets and those tickets only.\\n\", u\"\\nI still can't get how many people seem to be of the opinion that Hillary was bad (maybe so) so they would vote for Trump.\\nUltimate example of cutting your nose of to spite your face?\\n\", u'\\nOn the contrary, alienating tens of millions of ordinary people in the US is a sure way to help Trump succeed.\\nJust look at the damage caused in November by those voting for Stein. The US would very likely would not be in its current mess with Trump as president had Stein and her supporters not handed him several key states.\\n', u'\\nPlenty of \"establishment Democrats\" have been great examples of resistances. Maxine Waters, Barbara Lee, and John Lewis come to mind. Stop painting with broad strokes. \\nBernie Sanders has also been a disappointing with his remarks about how \"identity politics\" need to be ditched and his continuous marveling at Trump\\'s ability to galvanize the \"working class\" (aka working class white people). The identity politics he mentions are actually called civil rights and civil liberties, and they are being trampled on as we speak.\\n', u'\\nThe trouble with Corbyn now is that he had thrown his lot in with triggering article 50 not matter what the consequences.\\nInstead of showing restraint and sorting the pace down enough to have considered reflection and consultation, he just seems happy to scuttle the ship the try to negotiate a deal on the way down.\\nThe other side of that is that slimy New Labour neoliberals such as Yvette Cooper and David Miliband are trying to muscle in on the action thinking prime will forget what their voting record is, and policies try supported and pushed for.\\n', u'\\nYour post is in many ways a rerun of the \"Labour MPs represent their electorate\" argument used by the Blairites in UK Labour. In the US, as well as in the UK, established candidates are very rarely challenged from inside the party. In the US, unlike the UK, electoral districts are gerrymandered to the point where the actual vote counting becomes irrelevant, since the seats have been all but preallocated. Combine the two, and you\\'ll see why \"establishment\" Democrats\\' mandate is even flimsier than the one of Labour MPs.Trump built his \"movement\" from the ground up. You don\\'t fight that by a top-down, elitist approach such as the one the Dems have been using for at least 20 years. You fight it by building your own grassroots movement.

But I accept your point, Trump is not in disarray and although his policies are daft, he should be given a chance to govern.

At worst it is very much taking the low road. It is a pointless action that has rightly stirred up dissent.\\nThat Bush and Obama have done similar/bombed the shit out of those countries should also be remembered.\\n\", u\"\\nBhaskar Sunkara is correct; the Democratic Party must be reformed if it is to exist at all in the future. However, no one should underestimate the size of this job. The Clinton Democrats have access to large amounts of money, and have huge amounts of patronage to dispense.\\nIn California, since long before Sanders, there has been a separate non-establishment wing of the Democratic Party. Greens and Democratic Socialists have much in common with these Democrats.\\nIn particular, the Green Party, which has always struggled to obtain ballot access and finance candidates, has grown recently. Green principles and Bernie Sanders's principles have much in common. Many Greens would probably have voted for Sanders if he had been on the ballot.

I would consider myself a swing voter and may have voted Trump had I been a US citizen under certain circumstances. The name calling and mud slinging is not enough to win elections, Trump regardless of how abhorrent he maybe, at least was clear in his intention and is implementing it as described.\\nI am sure I will get a lot of abuse for the statement but I am extremely left wing in some thinking and right leaning in others. The left needs strong and clear leadership now, I certainly could not vote for Labour at the minute under Corbyn and no amount of condesending celebrity twitterings and street protests will be enough to sway me.\\n', u'\\nFirst-past-the-post voting is why there are only two viable parties.\\n', u'\\nVery sound points to make. The Democratic party needs to find a credible opponent to Trump (no more Clintons, please)\\n', u\"\\nThat reads as much like a Sanders propaganda piece as an anti-Trump diatribe.\\nYou have to remember that America is a notoriously right of centre country. This is a country which actually sees the Clintons as left wing. That's how right wing America is. So it's entirely possible that having a genuine social democrat like Sanders on the ticket would have driven more people into the objectionable arms of Trump. Let's deal with the realpolitik and admit that the person to support is the one that's most likely to beat Trump in four years time.\\nAnd, let's face it, it shouldn't be too difficult to beat him. We were prepared for a nasty, vicious, anti-intellectual, ultra-nationalistic President when we realised that Trump had won. And we've got that. But we've got it with an added dollop of hopeless amateurism thrown in. For instance, how come nobody in the administration realised it would look bad if Trump didn't include those countries where he does business into his disgraceful travel ban? How come the administration spent time pointlessly trying to tell us that there were millions of people at the inauguration when it was obvious hardly anybody had shown up? Quite simply, it's because they are a bunch of hopeless amateurs. Not only do they not know how to run a country. They don't even know how to make it look like they know how to do so.\\nAs long as there are people willing to vote for nasty, objectionable, racist policies there will be a possibility of people like Trump assuming power. But his own amateurism and incompetence is ultimately what's going to bring him down.\\n\", u'\\nThe media are against Trump and they lost and cannot get over it hence the big coverage.\\nFact is that hundreds of millions are not against Trump. \\nThe media, which is largely Muslim controlled, cannot accept it.\\n', u\"\\nFinally someone is talking sense about US Politics. \\nIf you support urgent action on AGW climate change then check out Dr James Hansen's intelligent idea - a new revolutionary peaceful third party of the Centre Moderate electorate and environmentalists for sustainability who typically accept reason, logic, science and evidence based policy vs bs lies spin and inaction. http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/\\nI am a political Independent, fed up with both of our major parties.http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2016/20160414_Electioneering.pdf \\nParamount among the latter is the need for a third party, distinct from present inept minor parties.

Move over to the dark side, under the tutelage of Steve Bannon a.k.a Darth Vader?\\n', u\"\\nIt is better to vote for what you want and not get it than to vote for what you don't want and get it. -Eugene V. Debs\\n\", u'\\nThey are being ditched. Some are heroes already. Looking for Republican heroes too.\\n', u'\\nBernie Sanders was the right candidate to lead the Democrats.They had the winner in their hands.\\nThat in itself shows how the Democrats need shaking up.\\n', u\"\\nTrump is a conman but he is really good at identifying issues that matters. He also has shown willingness to sacrifice few of his fellow billionaires if he deems that is useful for his ends. Wait until he actually creates some jobs and make health care more affordable: no I am not nuts, these are the proven and true steps of autocrats and ordinary conmen.Once he firmly established his grip in power, he can take all of them back while enriching himself and personal cronies. This is how it worked for Mussolini, Hitler, and lately Erdo\\u011fan.\\nThe democrats, if they want to stay relevant, must swiftly change their corrupt leadership and rhetoric; starting with their silly campaign about immigration. The reality is most Americans don't want them, the only beneficiaries are big corporations that gets cheap engineering workforce. Besides who started the immense refugee problems: all of the previous presidents. \\nA superficial opposition that avoids major issues while the executive power talks about them is bound to fail. My suggestion would be to focus on real issue a like his tax cuts, and actual corruption that is sure to be signature features of his infrastructure campaign\\n\", u\"\\nPerhaps...if one's goal is only to stay home behind your computer, and send money. The rest of us are needed in the streets to resist Trump.\\n\", u\"\\nLabour is tiredThe Democrats are tired\\nThe public voted Trump in and in the UK the Tory party\\nsee Cenk Yugar's new party 'Justice Democrats' on TYT. At least he's trying.\\n\", u\"\\nYep. It's really Muslims themselves who can have the greatest impact, by speaking out against extremism, and publicly reinforcing their commitment to the values of the countries where they now reside.\\n\", u\"\\nI'd feel a whole lot more confident about the resistance to Trump if the American left and centre showed signs of pulling together. Yes, establishment Democrats have been a massive disappointment. But right now anyone who supports liberal democracy and wants to avoid climate disaster and fascist takeover should be looking for common ground. \\nI'm afraid this article reminds me of the 'no significant difference between Trump and Clinton' attitude that contributed to Trump's election. \\nIt also ignores the fact that the biggest chunk of Trump's vote came from affluent people voting for the right-wing candidate because that's they support conservative policies. Field a populist left-wing candidate and Trump will keep all of those voters, plus take a few moderates who voted Clinton this time. And there's no guarantee that Rust Belt voters who were culturally attracted to Trump's pitch will desert him in droves next time. \\nMy advice is advocate left-wing policies and at the same time be willing to compromise and get behind the anyone but Trump candidate.\\n\", u'\\nThe whole system has to collapse first, or be destroyed, before any meaningful change happens, including capitalism. That will be painful and probably spill blood unless you believe in the so called velvet revolution theories. Probably another war is required. However, with nuclear bombs that could mean our last ever war and reversion to cave dwelling.\\n']\n",

last week has shown us anything, it\\u2019s that Donald Trump has power, but he doesn\\u2019t have much of a mandate yet.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>We need to keep it that way \\u2013 and be wary of the bad political leadership and strategy that can help him build one. November\\u2019s election is a powerful reminder that the Clinton establishment\\u2019s mix of socially inclusive rhetoric and neoliberal economics is a weak response to xenophobic populism.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>An anti-Trump resistance movement must be broad, but it must direct its anger and energy not just at the enemy in the White House, but the failed leadership that let him get there. The Tea Party movement couldn\\u2019t have emerged with Bob Dole and George W Bush among their leaders. We can\\u2019t build our anti-Trump resistance, settled with generations of unpopular Democratic party leaders either. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The alternative must come from below \\u2013 and certainly protests like the Women\\u2019s March are inspiring starts. Millions marched, many of whom had never attended a political protest before. It was hopefully a sign of things to come. Yet it is crucial that we know what this broad movement is for, as well as what it is against. <br/></p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>For years, myself and others posed a divide in the Democratic party that seemingly existed only notionally: a gap between social democratic demands at the base of the party and technocratic neoliberalism at the top of it. The Sanders campaign made that divide more real and tangible \\u2013 it stirred a rabid opposition to Clintonism within millions of people, many of them politicized for the first time, and more importantly presented an alternative politics.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Now a whole generation of Sanders <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are engaged in a process that at its best creatively produces divisions and polarizations within the party that complements the organizing that is going on outside of it.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The broad sketches of an alternative-left politics in the Trump era are emerging. Socialists and others are doing their part building social movements organized around real, uncompromising demands for things such as free public higher education and a dignified healthcare system to expand the base for progressive politics, while using local elections (both within Democratic primaries and as independents) to spread their message far and wide.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But though he\\u2019s seemingly in disarray now, we must be wary of the ways in which Trump\\u2019s support can easily be bolstered. <br/></p>', u'\\n', u'<p>We should be very afraid when the president of the Building Trades Unions umbrella group, Sean McGarvey, calls the meeting he had with Trump last week the best of his life. Our response in the labor movement must be to support rank-and-file struggles against leaders prone to conciliation for even the most meager of concessions. We must demand the same accountability from liberal organizations and the Democratic party as well.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>There is no doubt that this stance will put like-minded leftists and liberals in direct confrontation with establishment Democrats and their assorted lackies.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>There is every reason to believe that if confronted, this caste can be overtaken. We\\u2019re in a shocking new political era. Just in the past few months, thousands of people have joined leftwing organizations such as the Democratic Socialists of America, and millions more are trying to get active politically at the local level.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But we\\u2019ve seen time and time again \\u2013 the antiwar movement of the 2000s being just the most recent example \\u2013 of what happens when people subordinate all other political priorities to fighting Enemy No 1.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Trump is bad and needs to resisted, we all know that. But the Sanders left and its allies are the only force in the US that have the ideas that can win an immediate majority in this country: a class-based movement for jobs and justice.

      "comment_text [u'\\nHe was being interviewed by Piers Morgan. Pretty sure he was one of Trumps advisors\\n', u'\\nComments on this thread will close shortly. Thanks for your contributions.\\n', u\"\\nThere is no career advancement for you in opposing Trump, Owen.\\nThis is work for great statesmen and women.\\nWe've already established that May is not one of them, and we didn't need your help in spotting it.\\n\", u'\\nNever knew Spain was located Lalaland.\\n', u\"\\nIn what way does Merkel's misjudgement make Trumps racist actions acceptable to you? Have the guts to own your own racism, don't try and blame it on someone else.\\n\", u'\\nSuggest you read this from the BBC:\\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38798588\\nThis report explains why the 7 countries were picked. They had already been identified as \"countries of concern\" by the US Congress so no surprise that Trump and his team have done what they did. So all talk of discrimination on grounds of race and religion is baloney, but then not let\\'s spoil an excuse for an anti US demo with the truth.\\n', u'\\nSo true.\\n', u'\\nReagan ? ....maybe you also remember Spitting Image and their take on him ? personally I have always thought they got him too a tee and were spot on !\\n', u\"\\nAdam Curtis seems to believe in alternative facts - how odd! I'm very suspicious of this idea of a balanced version of history. All history is a construction - often by the powerful. What I do is construct an imaginative interpretation of history to make people look again at what they think they know.\\n\", u\"\\nI was told that a friend of a friend who's been a British citizen for 41 years, but is originally Iranian was going to visit his daughter in the US in the weekend and was prevented from catching his flight in the airport in a humiliating way. I was told he was devastated. I was also told that he wasn't even a Muslim! What the small minded Trump supports and Brexiteer type cannot fathom, is that this has nothing to do what you think of Islam. I'm against all Abrahamian religions myself. This is to do with blatant discrimination against whole nations by a PRESIDENT of a supposedly democratic country! Many people in these 7 countries are either not Muslims by birth, or if born into it, just don't believe in it. How would you feel if you were a British atheist, and were banned from going to a certain country because the majority in Britain are supposed to be Christians? Use your heads people, and look at what they're turning you into?\\n\", u\"\\nI take it you don't remember either!\\n\", u\"\\nBut, like I said the countries they have chosen aren't necesarily the ones where potential terrorists live - what about Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan...\\nAnd like I already said - why IRan? Iranians have never done terror attacks in the West as far as I can remember.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nA proto-fascist will not be defeated by a few rousing renditions of Kumbaya.\\n\\nMaybe that's where you're making your regular mistake, Owen, you and your chums who are so fast to reach for the tambourines. People get sick of hearing them, and the same dreary whiny theme every time.\\n\", u'\\nhttps://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/825580660337283073/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\n', u\"\\nNo, that is simply not true, to say that we have seen this before with Reagan. Reagan had been in politics for over a decade before becoming president, he was not a complete maverick, who was totally new to the game. He'd benn playing within the established rules for years.\\n\", u'\\nI can and I did. And it looks like you are full of it.\\n', u'\\nIt is about oil. Trump has already said about Iraq \"we should have taken their oil\". Well, now they have a chance to pressure these countries to give their oil to the likes of Exxon. They will be forced, one way or another, to do so.\\n', u\"\\nWe are doomed - a PM who loves to grandstand but has incredibly poor judgement all round. She is not a strategic thinker, not a planner, no real insight into European or world politics - pretty damming really.\\nThe only bonus of the events of the past few months is that it is now easier than ever to lump Trump, May, Le Pen, Farage and the Brexiters into a readily identifiable group against whom we can fight. \\nAnd let's be honest - May is just as bad as any of the others mentioned above. She may not have the intelligence that Le Pen has, but that is just as dangerous. Her willingness to lie down and roll over is shameful.\\nWhat we need now is the date from May for her newest pal's visit so that we can show her and him what we think about their love in.\\n\", u'\\n\"can some of you explain to me the logic behind banning everyone from these countries?\".So not to discriminate..Its like the security at the airport where the family of 5 is treated the same as the shifty looking single middle eastern gent\\n', u\"\\n\\nThere will be those in Britain who say: this is none of our business \\u2013 Trump is for Americans to deal with.\\n\\nThey are right. US immigration policy is an internal matter for the US people. It impacts on us only in so far as it restricts the travel of UK citizens. It is appropriate for the UK government to seek an agreement with Washington which protects the rights of UK citizens only. That has been done by the Foreign Secretary. \\n\\nBecause of Theresa May\\u2019s determination to exit the single market, our prime minister is making a strategic decision to ally with Trump\\u2019s administration\\n\\nHistorically, we have nearly always been allied with all US adminstrations. That has not been a 'slavish' relationship either. Wilson told the USA where to go when it sought to involve the UK's armed forces in Vietnam. There was no negative fallout from that. That close relationship allowed a very quick exemption for UK passport holders from the newly introduced immigration controls Trump has implemented. God knows how long it will take London and Brussels to work out a reciprocal travel policy once we are out of the EU. Remember, Owen, that even in the EU our biggest single nation state trading partner is ....... the USA. So, when we leave the EU it will be a simple case of 'plus \\xe7a change...'\\nDon't worry about it. Trump will be there for a maximum of 8 years. On the other hand, the anti-democratic EU Commission will be there for ever and ever and ..\\n\", u'\\nI do agree with your comment to a degree but the EU has been hostile towards us and we should keep all options open.\\n', u'\\nFunny how Obama and others have done the same as Trump but not a peep was said, the liberal left and the luvvies love a good protest so they can meet up with old friends.\\n', u'\\nWe were doing extremely well being a member of the EU.It remains to be seen how well we do outside of the EU.\\n', u\"\\nSupport the campaign to stop Trump and his dreadful racist and sexist administration.https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928/\\nTrump is causing huge divisions in the Tory Party, has been condemned by the Prince Charles, the Chief Rabbi and the Pope, is being challenged by innumerable lawsuits, has been deplored by musicians from Madonna to Rihanna and Bruce Springsteen to John Legend and is galvanising a tsunami of opposition across the globe on an unprecedented scale.\\nAnd it's worth knowing that the counter petition that's campaigning for Donald Trump to enjoy a full state visit has been launched by an extremely wealthy member of the Establishment and a leading UKip funder.His name is Augustus Alan Brown from Dover.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3715446.stm\\n\", u\"\\nbut they can't stop the number of signature shooting up, just as they can't stop Brexit :-)...\\n\", u'\\nSo what is the alternative ? Play stooge to another dictatorship where we have less in commeon and no power at all (EU) ?\\n....And what about Junker and company .? I think maybe worse than Trump ....much worse, and I mean just as outspoken , undiplomatic and ugh\\n', u\"\\nEven she now admits she didn't. And Mark Rutte is telling migrants to be normal or go home! The hypocrisy is unbelievable.\\n\", u\"\\nIt's not the left he's taking on you fool. Can't you see it's a race thing?\\n\", u'\\nWhy reply to this Freidenkerr wind-up merchant?\\n', u'\\nSo, if I am to understand you, Russia was unable to invade Europe by force. In your opinion Trump likes Putin. Both Trump and Putin are ego maniacs. And due to this shared ego mania Putin will love Trump back.\\nOkay, I follow you so far. I agree, the US prevented the Soviets from taking Europe. It remains to be seen if Trump and Putin are best friends, the Ukraine may put an end to that soon. \\nANything else, some reason you do not want America to have a good relationship with the Russians? I do not remember the Europeans whining when Hillary tried her reset button. Just the normal anti-Trump views, or did something happen to frighten Europe?\\n', u'\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s presidency will make Nixon look like a paragon of integrity by the time it is finally over.\\n\\nI don\\'t think you are old enough to remember the furore that greeted the Reagan presidency Owen but the truth is those that do have seen all this before.\\nHe was the \"War monger\" who was going to cause WW3. On 14th August 1984 he announced \"bombing begins in 5 mins\".\\nBy that time the left leaning press had already expended its entire lexicon of deprecatory name calling on him, and so was rendered virtually speechless in its apoplexy.\\nNow they have all \"forgotten\", because his approach actually didn\\'t bring war, it brought peace! \\nWe can now look back And recognise that the protestors had actually been desparate to undermine what became the greatest break through in east west relations ever.\\nBut we shouldn\\'t be cynical about the naivety of youth because as they say, life is for learning.\\n', u'\\nBoth part of a liberal elite\\n', u'\\nObama and Trump seem on a par in looking presidential I would say. Gerald Ford was probably the worst in my lifetime. Bill Clinton didn\\'t look very presidential when denying he had sexual relations with \"that woman\" (she\\'s got a name Bill!).\\n', u\"\\nTrump doesn't sleep anyway he tweets.\\n\", u\"\\nThere is no 'special relationship. It's a British delusion.\\n\", u'\\nNo islamic country has ever done anything like this.\\n', u'\\nSeeing as there are few Trump fans here, can some of you explain to me the logic behind banning everyone from these countries?And if you say \"security\", please, we all know that is BS. How often do Iranians go around do terrorist attacks in the West? Really if you were going to ban people based on who has done terrorist attacks in America, you should ban Saudis (9/11), Jordanians and Russians (Boston boming). Also, North African countries if we are including attacks in Europe.So keeping in mind that this has nothing to do with terrorism, what is it all about?\\n', u'\\nDone Sommerhit stupid.What to do next?Do the next stupid thing. Trump the EU\\n', u'\\nNot all on the left, she has pursued the brutalities of Harz 4 against the unemployed, etc like any Tory or Blairite(Schroder, who created Harz 4) would, but of course the domestic poor are a sideshow to the liberal left.\\n', u\"\\nKerry - They're desperate to prevent the people of the UK expressing their views.\\n\", u'\\nso sad to see a woman allowing this joke of even a clown, to grab her and her nation by the pussy.\\n', u\"\\nThe EU has shafted us to a degree and now you think we should burn our bridges with the USA because of one idiot. Thankfully we haven't got an over emotional Labour government running the show!\\n\", u'\\nYeah but no but... Obama promised change and mmm well nothing major changed.... Trump promised change and now expect an earthquake.\\n', u\"\\n\\nIt nonetheless needs repeating \\u2013 until we are blue in the face \\u2013 that this is not a normal president. The usual playbook of opposition does not apply to an authoritarian, bigoted demagogue who does not conform to democratic norms. A proto-fascist will not be defeated by a few rousing renditions of Kumbaya.\\n\\nDog whistle stuff. I expect that kind of rhetoric from the SWP, I don't expect it from a supposedly reputable Labour journalist. That is the kind of rhetoric that should only be used by people on the left when faced with genuine threats to our safety. It is the kind of rhetoric that was needed before the Battle of Cable Street. It most certainly is not needed now.\\n\", u'\\nWhy thank you John_Davies, coming from you that means a lot. Perhaps I was using you to represent all of Europe, a large burden I am afraid, but one in which the good outways the bad.\\n', u\"\\nMathew, in what way are you less elite than who makeup the 'liberal elite ' you refer to.\\n\", u\"\\nA guy on tv eh?

But the reaction to what he has done is completely out of proportion and hysterical.\\nWhat you need to remember is that he won the election for a reason. If he is enacting policies, that is because he was elected to do so. Having protests because of that is ridiculous. It would be more logical to protest if he did not do what he said.\\nCalifornia and NY had about 6.5m more Clinton voters than Trump. That is where the media are which is why the press act as though he barely scraped votes from his own family. But he won EVERY swing state in the election. 39 states had an increased vote share for Republican over Democrat. It was a really quite stunningly overwhelming electoral victory. Clinton barely won New Hampshire for goodness sake!!!\\nPeople need to stop protesting and start listening. Why did people vote that way? How does society need to change to meet those concerns?

You also say Trump as only been in the job a week so how does he know everything about these countries. This is the same man who thought Paris was in Germany. He acts like he knows little about anything outside his own bubble. These are executive orders he signs and he does it like a kid at show and tell. 'Hey folks guess what I did!' Why is he doing all of this in the first week he is in office. He sacks people who disagree with him and he takes the p*ss out of people upset by his policies. Trump is a obnoxious person with no empathy and is it a accident that he doesn't put in travel bans for where is business interests are. And while you are at it why didn't Obama action this if it was such a urgency surely this is something he would do. I can honestly say never really been a fan of any US President.

The Blair/Bush relationship was one born of warfare and bombing innocent civilians.\\nMay knows better than to get involved in some Middle-East scrapfest not of her making.\\n', u\"\\nWhy is this so different to the actions of every other US President? Bush had his axis of evil and Obama also had his list of enemy states. \\nThe Trump order states that ' immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States'\\nBut the section of the INA to which he refers, i.e. the list of countries which now have the immigration ban, was put in place by none other than President Obama in late-2015/early-2016. I don't recall the huge outcry at the time?\\nYes, Trump is making a lot more noise about it but let's not pretend this is anything wildly different to what was happening in the previous administration. It is not as though Syrians had an easy time at immigration as it is.\\n\", u\"\\nI agree with most of what Owen says except one thing - the demonstrations being planned. They will not worry Trump at all. All they will do is give him the attention he craves so much. What would be much more effective would be if no one turned out to wave at him or gesticulate angrily etc. Imagine if the streets were empty. if it was all a damp squib. If right thinking MPs, celebrities etc from all sides of the political spectrum ignored his visit. If we just didn't pay attention...\\n\", u'\\nThe UK bans some people from entering too.\\nAn Iraqi colleague at work has had his UK visa denied twice.

The claim is questionable. The anti-war demonstration in Washington on November 15, 1969 is commonly estimated to have drawn at least half a million people, with some estimates considerably higher. This is from a contemporary newspaper account:\\n\\nThe \"modest estimate\" of 250,000 by Police Chief Wilson, repeated in all papers \\u2014 inexplicably even by The Sun \\u2014 was made by him at 11:30 a.m., and the chief never changed his estimate, even though the mayor had guessed 450,000 in the early afternoon. Newsmen on the platform almost uniformly estimated 800,000, but you would never know that by reading their articles the next day, where the magic number of the Chief always appeared. At least one radio station estimated 1,500,000 from a helicopter. The Mobe marshals, making their estimate from counting those who stepped into the march at the Mall, said the crowd was slightly over one million.\\n\\nThat same day other rallies were held across the U.S., with up to a quarter of a million gathering in San Francisco. One month earlier perhaps two million in total attended marches and rallies. Marches, rallies, sit-ins went on weekly or even daily for years before and after.\\n', u'\\nSeems like Guardian readers have suddenly become little Englanders, afraid to stand up to Trump or continue to support the EU.

Trump may not appeal to the limousine liberals as they are known in the USA, but he won. Instead, the liberal left can go and protest against another group who cannot be named but where women are not treated as equals to men as a matter of ideological dogma.\\n', u\"\\nerm.. Trump did say that he would do all these things in his campaign manifesto.\\nNow I know this is remarkably unusual in that all politicians in my memory have said what they'd do and then ignored all their promises the say they get elected, but Trumpy is at least doing everything he promised. So we've got no-one to blame but the electorate (or the system that didn't give much in the way of choices)\\n\", u'\\nBeing put down in Europe or Great Britain will have the whale beached.\\n', u'\\n\"America is going to secure its boarders . . . .\" Do you mean that the disenfranchised classes who must live in boarding houses will be placed under house arrest, or that Americans will become so poor under Trumponomics that they\\'ll have to take in boarders?

However so far Trump is not attempting to smash unions and workers organisations and he is therefore not fascist .\\n', u'\\nThere will be those in Britain who say: this is none of our business \\u2013 Trump is for Americans to deal with.And they would be correct. He may be several sultanas short of a fruit cake, but Trump is the elected President of the United States until such a time as the US electorate decide otherwise. No amount of righteous indignation from protesters in the UK will change that. If anything, it may strengthen his position among his supporters.\\n', u'\\nCompared to right-wing sources like brietbark (that most savvy conservatives will not even try to bring into this house), sure Mediate is a journalistic oriented organisation.\\n', u'\\nI love the argument of big business regarding Britain leaving the EU. \\nOur costs are going to go up, so obviously prices will have to go up. \\nOf course the fact that they made however many billion in profits last year is not mentioned. Or that the other way they could mitigate for rising prices would be to accept lower profits.\\n', u'\\nTrump\\'s \"America first\" edict on trade deals is that trading nations must spend more on US goods than the US spends in return. We have nothing to look forward to there.\\n', u'\\nMillions of Americans cannot discern between fact and opinion, hence the belief in \"alternative\" facts.\\n', u'\\nAs a person with dual American and British citizenship, I can tell you that watching Theresa May\\'s behaviour since Trump\\'s election has sickened me beyond words. This government\\'s decision to refuse to hold the President of the USA to any standard of decency, to overlook his policies that violate any kind of basic humanity, to stand by him and praise his \"stunning victory,\" are despicable. Theresa May\\'s rushing off to meet Trump then Erdogan is shameful. Who\\'s next? Putin? Maybe Kim Jong-un would like to make a trade deal.. Maybe he too would like to buy some fighter jets. Because once we start believing that trade deals \"trump\" upholding basic human rights and care for our fellow human beings, we are living in a world of alternative facts indeed. \\nI am an immigrant and I stand with immigrants around the world affected by Trump\\'s executive order.

Please, on behalf of my friends and family in the USA, don\\'t stop.\\n', u\"\\nFascism, by definition, is a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power. Now tell me georgina, without fudge or obfuscation, how is it that Mr Trump has complete power? In simple terms Georgina, that means Mr Trump can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, without legal challenge or constitutional restrictions and can't be voted out. A fascist is someone that can also prevent public criticism and control the press. Now tell me ......is that what Trump can do????\\n\", u'\\nThis looks like an Express or Daily Mail comments page.\\n', u'\\nI\\'ve seen many Guardian articles that cover... \"reasons, systems and processes\".

What I am bothered about is that Trumps fascist views and mindless executive orders are being exported. I object to my PrimeMinister holding Trumps hands, appeasing a moron like him and not having the nerve or the guts to say that what he is doing is wrong. If Americans are that stupid to vote someone like him in then so be it. But I am not going to stay quiet about it and say ok then I am happy Trump is the US President because I am not and since when have I not been able to express my point of view in Britian about a US President.\\n', u\"\\nIt is wonderful to see how a delay of a few weeks for immigrants from countries known to contain terrorists can get our chattering classes in a knicker twist.America is going to secure its boarders, and of course big businesses are up in arms. The reason is that lots of immigrants mean low wages for American workers, just as it does for British workers. Now we can't have that. Nothing, absolutely nothing , must interfere with the profits of Ford and Google and the rest. Just think of the pain of being down to your last billion!\\n\", u'\\nSomehow I doubt a lot of British people demonstrating will make a difference. It could even make it worse.

The \"ever closer union\" period has in fact seen many countries pull away and disengage from the process, Germany and France in particular. Now there seems to be a greater realism developing. The EU has found itself and its member countries becoming vulnerable to both external political pressure and external pressure on its precarious financial systems. At the same time, convergence processes have stumbled and been resented, both because of Euro structure problems and because of the failure to recognise national, regional and cultural priorities. These things are being recognised and there is grounds for optimism that a new phase of EU development is possible, driven less by the pursuit of closer union and more by the need to make the EU a source of stability for its members in a changing world. Much will depend on how dangerous Trump makes matters, as this will effect the elections in France and Germany.

Check out Owen how EU citizens are treated by the tabloid media, the Home Office and the government. Do not loose sight of the injustice happening to us who have made the UK our home. The injustice of retrospectively applying new rules and bullying EU citizens into leaving, many of whom have been living and working here since decades, before the UK even left the EU. It is not much different than stopping people from coming in. The end game is the same, not having them. \\n3 million EU citizens whose situation is precarious and are threatened with deportation in letters from the Home Office if they dare to apply for Permanent Residency out of fear of the overhanging uncertainty. \\nIt is not the question of correctly filling in an 85 page form (in most EU countries it is a 1 page document) and supplying a shed load of information but the deliberate and malicious 30% refusal rate on arbitrary, cruel reasons, like not including original passport when the form clearly states you are allowed to hand in a certified copy, and the illegal letters that follow threatening people with deportation. The UK hasn\\'t left the EU yet, until then these letters are illegal and are sent out every day.\\nPeople married to British citizens are scared and live in stress whether they will be forced to leave with their families or better yet, separated from them and threatened with deportation on their own. (If one is married to an EU citizen he/she can sponsor his/her spouse on his PR form as a dependant but if one is married to a British national the EU spouse needs to apply on their own merit, housewives are automatically disqualified as they have no independent earnings.)\\nMost people living here over 5 years do not know about the CSI, the private healthcare insurance they were supposed to take out, but it is a prerequisite to apply for Permanent Residency.\\nOppose Trump, you must, him and the government\\'s alignement with his fascist agenda. Everybody with an ounce of reason and humanity should. But look at what is happening to EU citizens who had no say in what is happening to them and are continually treated as bargaining chips in a red, white and blue Brexit.\\nVictim blaming is a particularly insidious part of this. People say it is the EU\\'s fault that their citizens are dehumanised. Because the EU could have guaranteed reciprocity. The problem with this is that firstly, it is the UK that wanted to leave the EU, secondly the EU cannot guarantee anything legally until the UK has actually left. Besides plenty of countries like Germany already declared UK citizens will be able to stay and keep their EU rights. Thirdly, the UK will have to negotiate with 27 separate countries as the EU is not responsible for individual countries\\' immigration policies. That is why a quasi fascist state like Hungary was able to build a shameful fence to keep refugees out. In this context, blaming the EU for how the UK is treating EU citizens living and working here is nonsensical and malicious. \\nI don\\'t care if people think that I should not be absurd, there will be no deportations. Most people didn\\'t think Trump would get to be the front runner let alone president. As it stands my 19 year old son does not qualify to remain in the UK after living here since he was 6 months old. It hangs over us, like the sword of Democles. People, politicians and many others deny us the right to call this island our home. We are portrayed as the cancerous Other that needs to be removed. \\nThe tragedy of this doesn\\'t seem to interest anyone enough to do something about it in solidarity. We were not banned, we will just be quietly told to leave by the Home Office, every day dehumanised, bullied by the tabloid media and the government in inflammatory language fit for Trump (check out the last Conservative Conference for particular gems by May, Fox and Rudd), or barriers in our ways of staying will be placed or just the indignity of the stress of this uncertainty will make us leave on our own accord, as many have already done so. \\nThe group the3million were told by the Guardian about \"reader fatigue\" when they wanted to offer more information about our plight. Clearly the interest is very little in the ongoing suffering of EU citizens in this climate of xenophobia. People seem to be accepting of this or not bothered enough to realise the parallels with Trump\\'s America. Is the principle really that different? \\nEvery single day EU citizens are verbally abused, bullied by work colleagues, neighbours, the media, the HO and the governement. It seems our own voices are not needed in the discourse about us. Mo Farrah doesn\\'t like being treated as a second class citizen.

Social Liberalism has been at the very heart of Denmark's core values, and its success, in Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries, proves that social liberalism can thrive without hypocrisy. Our Social Liberalism has a few rules:\\nIn Denmark you must be fluent in Danish to live in Denmark. Most Danes are fluent in at least one other language, and as I am British I am also fluent in Welsh and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, and Latin-American Spanish. Yes, that makes me far above the mean of even Denmark, but I really enjoy languages, and have been since a very young age.\\nYou must be tolerant of our 'liberal' policies and our social attitudes. I am not stating that there never been heated discussions on Society and Government. I've never been to an event, ever, where there wasn't at least one heated exchange over just about everything, but at the end of it we then come to a respect for each other, and some of these might only end by agreeing to disagree.\\nSo I believe your theory is flawed, but that's your decision. Religion does create many divisions, and this has been the basis of many wars. When many of the World's larger Faiths promote a militant demand to convert others to their beliefs, conflicts do frequently arise. \\nWith the population on Earth still racing towards eight billion, and the resources of the Planet are incapable of currently providing for this demand there will be escalations by those that are accustomed to its constant availability. I do not find Trump to have the emotional fitness for the Office of President of the United States and achieve his very dangerous views. He is deliberately using outrageous Machiavellian manoeuvres for years, and since his Inauguration the links to dangerous outcomes has shown a far more dangerous direction. It is something that suffocates freedom and has never ended well.\\n\", u\"\\nAre the Guardian's columnists going to have the stamina to keep up their anti-Trump invective for the entire eight years of President Trump's tenancy of the White House?\\n\", u'\\nHitler was austrian...yeah, and the austrians have been smart enough in letting him be nothing bigger than a postcard painter.

Trump is following the classic fascist hitlist:-rejection of liberalism and indeed conservatism, although true to historical form conservatives are his enablers-rampant nationalism-national revival (MAGA) from a supposed national humiliation-vilification/scapegoating of minorities-national victimhood (all those foreigners taking advantage of the weak USA)-wannabe autocratand he even has the gun toting wannabe brown shirts\\nA little historical perspective is probably in order.\\n\", u'\\nYes to Saudi Arabia as one example.\\n', u\"\\nHe didn't halt refugees from Iraq for six months.He didn't halt refugees from one of the most war-torn countries in the world indefinitely.He didn't rush into things and cause chaos without telling various arms of the government what he was doing.He did set up a system of vetting which already requires a couple of years checking before you can get in.None of the countries on Trump's list have delivered anyone to the US who has carried out a terrorist act in the US.Several other countries that actually have delivered terrorists have not been included in Trump's ban.Trump happens to have businesses in some of those countries.\\n\", u\"\\nWhilst there are plenty of other issues to protest against Trump, in this instance methinks that Owen Jones protests too much:\\n(1) Trump is carrying out his manifesto, under which he was voted in office. Policing of borders is a reasonable policy, carried out by most countries to a greater or lesser extent.(2) I don't remember a similar level of protest against UK and USA interference, bombing raids and drone strikes against Middle East countries, so causing civilian deaths, and indirectly increasing the number of refugees.\\n\", u\"\\nThere doesn't seem the same level of hostility towards other country representatives who have come here and have poor human rights. China had a state visit, no one is protesting against Putin, Pakistan has regularly flouted human rights, where are those protests ? Trump was democratically elected, whether we like it or not.

You then twist what he said about Mexicans, what he said was that with no control a lot of Mexicans who you wouldn't want living next door to you or your mother are coming over the border with no control - that includes murders and rapists and of course drug traffickers. Baffles me why anyone I this country would be offended about him wanting to waste a load of their money building a wall - they already have a huge fence in place already, whats the problem with extending that? I have seen no banners in London about the fence already in place \\nalso, when did I say you hate Americans? you went on a rant about something I never mentioned.

Once this credo had been adopted by the majority of Islamic faiths, the USA could then consider permitting entry to every Muslim who signed up to that confession of faith.\\n\", u'\\nAnyone else noticed the greater effort that the self-styled progressive Left puts into protesting about a result than preventing the result in the first place?\\nJust a thought.\\n', u'\\nTell me how different he looks from Hitler at the start of his rule.

Firstly you have to remember the Americans arrived rather late in the day whilst Britain [and it's Empire] barely held the line alone. Then isolationist Congress only agreed to come in after Japan bombed Pearl Harbour. Furthermore you should remember the US only agreed to help in return for Britain giving up its Caribbean bases in return for some clapped out old naval vessels. So the US waited long enough until we flat on our backs and made us an offer we couldn't refuse. Oh yes and before I forget ... we just finished up paying the loans back that the US kindly saddled us with after about 60 odd years.\\nSince then of course the UK has got itself involved in Americas mess in Iraq. Courtesy of Blair as poodle in chief to the last cerebrally challenged President you went and 'voted' for. So really you got a rather good deal out of your WW2 exploits. How do you think the US would have fared with the Nazis ensconced from the Pacific to the Atlantic on a land mass about three times as large as the US and control of most of the world's oil?\\n\", u\"\\n\\nCount me in, Owen.\\n\\nYou too on Peckham high street having a protest, I'm thinking Delboy and Rodney flogging watches from a suitcase.\\n\", u'\\nThe flurry of EOs and memorandum is how all Presidencies start off.

Owen Jones was one of the main organisers of that. One of the main bugbears of the left is this country's support of the Saudi regime, particularly in supplying the arms they use to bomb Yemen. There were also many left-wingprotests, going back years, about the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. \\nBut I repeat my point: when a beacon of freedom and democracy shows signs of sliding into despotism, it is a qualitatively different matter to somewhere like Saudi Arabia or Syria doing it. If a US president starts disregarding the US constitution and the rule of law, we are all in big trouble. It is not an overreaction to be alarmed at that; in fact a lot of people are dangerously under-reacting.\\n\", u\"\\nIt's almost as if the stuff we were complaining about before he was president, we're complaining out now that he's president.

Oh. Trump has financial interests in those countries. Quite convenient, since he is the first President that has refused to divest himself from his business links and placing them in a Blind Trust, making it very easy to take a \"little more money\" from these countries and turn a blind eye to their atrocities, especially with Saudi Arabia. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi, and very good friends to the GOP and Trump, the bin Ladens, had a son that co-created this action with Al Qaida.\\nIt is not the term \\'racist\\' that has been shouted down over the past 20 years.

I know that all 17 Security entities of the United States Government were hacked into by an arm of the FSB, and Assange received only the information against Clinton for that controversial memo from Comey at the FBI. They also have breached the GOP Security, but why would Putin hand this to Wikileaks when he can use it to control his puppet, Trump.\\nI also know that Former Russian FSB Chief Oleg Erovinkin, who helped British Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele research and assemble the Russian blackmail file on President Trump, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow under suspicious circumstances. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/\\nI deliberately passed on the Telegraph\\'s mention of this because if I used a \\'liberal\\' source you would attempt to brush this off as some liberal Conspiracy Theory.

If they don't make a dent in the mid terms, it could be game over.\\nI wouldn't entirely give up hope yet, a lot of people are albeit quietly - stating their dismay at Trump and a regret for casting that vote. They did not understand the issues, they believed he would not do half of what he said but thought a shake up was needed or to be blunt, they were just plain stupid, not understanding that Obamacare was the ACA. Opinions can and do change. For the die hard bigots, tea party, nazi members, quite a bit of Trump's base, that won't change. But we need to remember that it is a mere 61 million people through a quirk in the system that put Trump where he is, 61 million out of an electorate of 250 million, a minority.\\n\", u\"\\nOn the picture , i can imagine a 200 crowd and one sign ,and this is London where 10 millions plus people lives and leaves.Hardly a spontaneous gathering.This sign took time to make so don't tell us it's spontaneous .\\n\", u'\\n\\nOf course Americans must lead the movement against their president.

Not unreasonable surely? Many in Europe would love to have someone as committed to preserving Western values and protecting their citizens as Trump intends to be.

Not even close. I know this was yesterday\\'s right wing rebuttal of choice, but it\\'s not remotely true. Obama heightened vetting for immigrants from Iraq, based on a genuine terror threat, he didn\\'t issue a blanket ban, and it wasn\\'t based on clumsy election promises and blind prejudice.\\n\\nAnd by the way all of the 7 countries also ban Israelis - where are the \\'universal social justice\\' warriors protesting that?\\n\\nIsn\\'t it a surprise how many right wing commenters are suddenly incredibly knowledgeable about the immigration policy of Middle Eastern countries, and so compassionate for the Israelis? Now, of course, if you actually cared about said immigration policy, and actually cared about the plight of Israelis, you\\'d consider that Trump\\'s immigration policy would actually hurt the chances of Israeli Jews fleeing persecution from the countries Trump has barred immigration from. But you don\\'t care, you\\'re just parroting the single sentence from wherever you get this crap from.\\nAs for \"why not protest against the other countries\\' immigration policies too\", I\\'ve explained in other comments on here how protest actually works, and why that\\'s a reductionist, overly simplistic argument. To put it simply, I\\'ll raise two points - one should think that a country priding itself on democracy and freedom and, historically, on being a cultural \"melting pot\" should be held to a higher standard than repressive regimes, and secondly, that we are better positioned to put pressure on the US government than on the government of Middle Eastern countries. Protest isn\\'t just about shouting the first injustice that comes into your head, it\\'s about placing pressure on elected officials. The idea that the \"leader of the free world\" is banning lawful travellers from entering his country - not emigrating to, simply entering it - is as unethical as the whole thing is ill thought out.\\n\\n\\nb) Everyone who has not visited Iraq reading this is guilty of \\'discrimination on grounds of nationality\\'.\\n\\nThis might be the silliest argument I\\'ve ever heard. Well done.\\n\\nOver 70 Muslim countries are not part of this ban so to describe it as anti Islam is just more big media hysteria\\n\\nThat\\'s impressive, considering there aren\\'t 70 Muslim countries in the world. It would be much easier to defend it as not being anti-Islam if Trump and his associates hadn\\'t referred to it as a Muslim Ban, though.\\n\\n\\nc) The big lie that liberal lefties some how stand opposed to \\'neo liberalism\\' is well and true put in the dustbin of history given that you/Amazon/Microsoft/ Goldman Sachs stand on the same side of every big issue\\n\\nGive me a workable definition of neo-Liberalism. \"Goldman Sachs\" doesn\\'t really work as a scary buzzword for you guys any more, considering Trump\\'s filled his staff with ex-Goldman Sachs employees. Though your syntax is starting to interest me now, just as an aside. Can\\'t think why that might be relevant. \\n\\n\\nd) Thankfully we will soon be leaving the EU and want to reach out to the USA to help grow the British economy. Pointless pathetic gestures around \\'banning\\' Pres Trump to keep some middle class professional agitators happy is not good policy and does nothing to protect the interest of the UK\\n\\nThey\\'re not \"banning\" Trump, they\\'re protesting against a State visit.

Ask her constituents. Perhaps you mean that we, the electorate didn\\'t vote for her party with her as leader. So what?

Aside from mutually assured destruction, it has been the integration of global supply chains that has contributed to the lack of direct conflict between major powers. If Trump gets what he wants and destroys the EU and pushes China's mercantile economy into (its perhaps inevitable) crisis, by bringing production back to the US, the world will become much more volatile. Outside of the EU, the UK will have little choice but to be part of the US fascist network. We are most certainly entering a very dangerous time and the rush to Brexit is cutting our options, even before it is clear what the dangers are. Just as the government would have been prudent not to rush to invite Trump for a state visit, it should be looking to keep an eye on how to exit Brexit if Trump changes the world in ways that being closer to the US is bad news.\\n\", u'\\nNo. Fascism is all about growing the state at the expense of personal liberty.\\n', u\"\\nI get the feeling you're one of those know it alls who knows nothing that wasn't fed to you by mainstream media. \\nBut as someone who realizes that we minions know very little, so endeavors to learn as much as I can about the world I live in and am humble enough to know there's much more to be uncovered- I can tell you- ignorance is bliss. \\nCarry on being a mindless drone please\\n\", u\"\\nThe hypocracy and abuse of their positions by Guardian journalists is staggering.

Trump\\'s personality disorder (which includes hypomania) is also displayed through a lack of impulse control and empathy, and \"a feeling that people ... don\\'t recognize their greatness.\\n\"We\\'ve seen enough public behavior by Donald Trump now that we can make this diagnosis indisputably,\" says Gartner. His comments run afoul of the so-called Goldwater Rule, the informal term for part of the ethics code of the American Psychiatric Association saying it is wrong to provide a professional opinion of a public figure without examining that person and gaining consent to discuss the evaluation.

But the fact is that the bulk of refugees are FLEEING Islamic terror, not perpetrating it. Visa vetting in the USA is already hugely stringent. \\nThere simply is no rational justification for the EO in its current form, and this is quite apart from the moral objection to refusing refuge to people fleeing war, and the patriotic objection of its being un-American.\\n\", u\"\\nExcellent comment, it was refreshing to read that after being so tired with the latest media-fueled mass hysteria. I do think Trump is a despot and he concerns me, but there are much smarter ways to handle despots. Iran have been quelled by alternative, nuanced thinking (Stuxnet then the Iran nuclear deal framework), not the reactionary base-level screaming that we're witnessing. \\nLet's be smart about how we handle Trump.\\n\", u\"\\nHe is not a dictator. He has signed a few EOs for certain countries (dozens of Muslim-majority countries are unaffected), compared to hundreds of EOs by Obama. He has selected virtually the same travel ban as Obama did, but for 90 days instead of Obama's 180 days. He has taken steps to reinforce a southern boundary that both Obama (to a lesser extent) and, more vigorously, Clinton were already bolstering. \\nIf you seek dictators, Owen, there are plenty about against which to grind an axe, but he is not one of them.

Most of these organizers had little grasp of history and they never seemed to have a problem with authoritarian regimes like the Soviet Union or China. Owen Jones with his constant calls to mobilise seems like a throwback. What does he know of Nixon? Of all the dictators he could have named he picks a president who lost his job for organising a failed break-in.

Doesn't the sanctimony of the liberal left just make you feel sick... However much pain and suffering we see on our TV screens through the liberal media of Muslims being held up at airports - is nothing in comparison to the death and destruction Clinton's no-fly-zone would've caused if she had been elected. I wonder whether all the 'progressives' and 'feminists' would be protesting then, when Syria was getting bombed to shit and Christians and Shias were being exterminated.\\n\", u\"\\nFirst I reckon Globalism could stand being pushed back a bit. For change to hold it can only progress at a pace the majority are comfortable with and the benefits have to be fairly distributed. Its been anything but.

He is only implementing what he said he would do during his campaign. A politician who keeps his word ? We cannot have that. Let us have those who soothe us with platitudes.

Trump will still be in power, his policies completely unchanged. And no doubt due to his notoriously thin skin he would be openly hostile towards the UK as well.\\nAfter Brexit, we need our leaders to be smart, play the long game and see what we (The UK) can get from this freako megalomaniac to help our economy, business world and security. \\nNow is not the time for empty moralizing (which would at best be futile, at worst completely counter-productive). \\nAnd as a footnote....

Without going into too much detail, Islamic ideology has proved to of major influence in the region for insurgents to recruit fighters against their enemy, and with their success Jihadist factions have taken swaths of territory. Continued warfare and regional destabilisation in Syria and Libya, in particular, has led to an extraordinary refugee crisis with western states, which has in-turn caused much social and political turmoil much closer to home. \\nThis has been a complete disaster, and we are facing the consequences of political and social instability, further compounded by a current underlying economic situation.

He will use a litany of executive orders to bypass Senate and Congress, he will use News Corporation media outlets to indoctrinate and condition, he will intimidate his adversaries with threats of violence for non-compliance, he will normalize sexism and racism claiming that objection to it is just political correctness, he will indulge in 'control by fear', he will continue to deal with sensitive diplomatic issues via Twitter, he will intentionally ignore evidence which contradicts his worldview, he will 'get away' with all criminal procedures (a list of sexual assault accusations rivalling Cosby, and business corruption and cronyism highlighted by four bankruptcies whilst CEO) under the Nixon-esque notion that if the President does it, it is not illegal. \\nHis agenda should never be appeased, his very questionable mandate should never be facilitated or enabled and peaceful conscientious objection should grow internationally on a daily basis. Peaceful obstruction is ENTIRELY noble. With great power comes great responsibility and currently, the highest platform is currently in the tiny hands of a serial abuser.

Therefore, on average for all the other states combined apart from California, the popular vote sided with Trump.

Narcissistic, flawed leaders (I think there is sufficient proof of both of these so far) are more-often-than-not brought down from within. Politicians crave votes and support. When that becomes seriously threatened, they turn. I also agree that one of the biggest mistakes we, in the UK, can make right now is trying to dictate what the US should or should not be doing in its own country - that DOES have a tendency to piss off the locals. That is a completely different thing to the world voicing on issues of human rights, human decency and freedom of speech. The press have a big responsibility here too. Fiery headlines and rhetoric, such as \"Banning Muslims\" is not helpful. (E.g. The hard fact is that he has not banned Muslims - merely the ones in countries where he has no business interests, and interestingly none of those countries who have citizens that have actually been responsible for the deaths of US civilians at home - take Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE as examples).

And truly a remarkable crowd it was too. I tend to bang on about demographics on CIF. This was astonishing. It was young, white middle-class and mixed male and female. (I\\'d guess that at least half of those present had been to Glastonbury in the last five years._ In a demographically diverse city like London you would have difficulty believing you weren\\'t in Bath or Guildford on a Friday night rather than in ultra-diverse London on a damp Monday evening in January. Even the House of Commons across the square is more ethnically diverse. That\\'s not to say that other demographics weren\\'t represented - there were a few of the usual suspects from Socialist Worker and a smattering of ethnic minorities but not so many as a 21st century commuting Londoner would register. The Socialist Worker mass-produced placards were dominant as ever but there were plenty of DIY sheets of cardboard attempting to out-boor Trump with the coarse vulgarity of their slogans. To give the flavour, one invited Theresa May to \"grow some ovaries\". Reading them kept the lines of bored policemen amused. \\nThere was a distinct lack of hats with cats\\' ears - perhaps their loving mums hadn\\'t finished crocheting them? Or perhaps they were still in the post. Whatever. The mood was excited and exuberant - they booed cheerfully , they chanted cheerfully. Because this is what our parents tell us they did at demonstrations. But there was o passion, no anger. None of the legendary edginess of Paris 1968, Grosvenor Square or the Poll Tax. The abandoned Boris buses and maintenance vehicles wenty untorched. One police van had its windscreen er, covered with placards and was surrounded by a semicircle of people taking photos on their smartphones. Scions of pop stars swinging from the assorted statuary were conspicuous by their absence. It was safer than watching Coronation Street. My quote of the evening came from a couple of young girls - \"let\\'s go over there, that looks different\" - straight off a packed suburban disco dancefloor and all the odder because of the utter uniformity of the bleached throng. \\nAnd although the assembled masses demanded loudly that Trump\\'s invitation be rescinded they didn\\'t really mean him any ill - he was merely the pantomime villain to be booed enthusiastically at every opportunity. And why should they wish him ill? After all the man had given them a wonderful excuse to abandon their studies in their uni libraries on a Monday evening. And if he gets to comes here they can do it all over again with the added excitement of all those secret service people with their ill-concealed firearms. And off home we went, smartphones stuffed full of selfies to watch ourselves on the telly, waiting for the call to do it all over again.\\n', u'\\nHistory shows appeasement of a dictator never works. Better to punch such a bully in the face.\\nWorked in Iraq.\\n', u\"\\nNormally I would agree with a mass demonstration against Trump, but unfortunately that is what will appeal to his narcissistic ego. Londoners staying at home with the curtains drawn and tourists turning their backs or staying in their hotels would be better. Not that he will be sitting in a carriage with the Queen being driven through the streets any way. He will probably have to be smuggled in through the trademens' entrance. Apart from that he could be impeached by then and be in jail with any luck.\\n\", u\"\\nClearly you seem to rather dense if you think Trump is the problem, seeing as it was Hussein Obama who used drones to bomb people like it was going out of fashion.America has crime issues, so perhaps denying entry to those 'statistically higher than average threat level nationals' would be advantageous to American society.It's not going to be 100% fair.

I know we don't expect that from the political classes -- carrying out promises, but this bloke is really sticking to his word. I think that's quite admirable. He's working solely for the USA's interests, after the people there have been neglected by global-spherists and so-called Republicans and Democrats for the last 3 decades. The top tier of the tech world in California might be railing against Trump's actions, but the plain fact is they're employing people on the cheap from abroad at the expense of the American worker.

Because remember those drone bombings during the last 8 years? Those were Hope and change bombs.\\n', u'\\nI think she was going to go anyways. Having said that, I agree with your other points.\\n', u\"\\nWill Trump's isolationist policies result in US involvement in more or fewer wars than Obama engaged in?\\nThat is a far more important question than whether Trump should deliver on his election promise about a temporary immigration ban.\\n\", u'\\nA credible political body to challenge Trump is clearly required from those of us who disagree with his policies.That will not come from people who support the morally and economically bankrupt far-left regimes like chavismo or Corbyn and his momentum thugs.\\n', u\"\\nActually I don't profoundly disagree with that, but it's not going to happen. We're too tribal to make such compromises, and our media and politicians actively discourage it by playing up to our biases. As such, the only way to resolve this is to be in possession of the narrative that the majority believes is the 'one truth' and run with it from there.\\nYes it's pathetic, but this is very much what we've inherited. The only remaining line we can come together on is the economy - by which I mean, unifying people around wealth inequality, rich vs poor, etc. It won't happen though because only the left can deliver it, and it's being actively hamstrung by the centre and the right.\\n\", u'\\nMulti-multiculturalism. And its effect. The left are responsible.\\n', u\"\\nYes, like Chamberlain worked with Hitler? It is true we have to work with him but we do not have to roll over for him. Do you seriously believe that he will care anything for a good trade deal with us when he says America first? Haven't you realised that he does in fact mean what he says?There comes a point in any relationship when you have to hold on to your dignity. By offering Trump a State visit in a desperate rush to get someone, anyone, to be friends with post Brexit Britain, you are devaluing the principles and ethics we believe in. THAT is why people are incensed and are demonstrating and venting. This is the time to make clear what we will and will not accept or we will be royally shafted, not just by Trump but the rest of the world looking on.\\n\", u'\\nIt is even more complicated than this, with economic reasons, the fall out of the first world war etc... absolutely zero comparison with USA today.\\n', u\"\\nIn your statement, replace 'Trump' with 'immigrants' and you're bang on the 2017 populist zeitgeist.\\n\", u'\\nWhat about Pakistan and Saudi?\\n', u'\\nIndeed, every cloud...\\n', u'\\nNo.\\n', u'\\nExcept there are exclusions made for non majority religions, i.e. It is a Muslim ban!\\n', u'\\nYeh no association with terrorism in Saudi or Pakistan...\\n', u'\\nThat is not the issue, the issue is whether to prevent Trump from receiving a state visit. Why this is so hard to grasp is bewildering.\\n', u\"\\nIt has to be said, what everyone forgets is the media's role in politics.\\nWhere to consider, who else does the informing for people to vote as they do and is that informing honest or are people being manipulated.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nThe choice becomes stark: either we side with Trump and all he represents or with European democracies. In view of the changed circumstances people who support Brexit are Trump's and Putin's stooges.\\n\\nNice try. So, according to your logic all the people that voted Remain are clearly the unpatriotic stooges of the global financial services industry bent on forcing the UK into the Eurozone so that we can join Germany in crippling countries like Greece. \\nI don't believe that because unlike so many people on here I know perfectly sensible people that have considered and principled reasons for voting both ways and who are able to disagree about the position of the UK vis a vis the EU without either supporting Trump, Putin, Guy Verhofstadt or the crazy austerity policies of the ECB.\\nYou should try talking to people out side your social media echo chamber occasionally. Just be polite and you'll find that you can have a decent debate and maybe just maybe hear something that makes you think a bit harder.\\n\", u'\\nWell said.\\n', u\"\\nDoes el Trumpo know that in British English his name means fart? If he doesn't when he arrives, we must make sure he does when he leaves.

I know its not exactly binary, but its certainly a step in the right direction? I appreciate he\\'ll probably end up doing both but lets hope not or force the issue?\\nReading behind and inbetween the lines all the guff I think the real story here is Bannon and co flushing out the road-blockers in the Washington bureaucracy. I find it unbelievable that when Amanpour gets called out on her hysterical \"Anti Muslim\" rhetoric and that she should perhaps be a little less emotional and rabble rousing that she continues lambasting the Trump administration for stirring up an angry Muslim pot by herself using language and perspectives that do just exactly what she is complaining about. Unbelievable.\\nSeemingly no decent journalists to report and understand anything that is really going on and we\\'re only 10 days in. I fear for America, not because of Trump and Bannon, but because the press and the Washington bureaucracy are being played and they are biting every single piece of bait - from crowd sizes, to Churchill busts, to moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, to mis-spelling Theresa May\\'s name, to not mentioning Jews in Holocaust rememberance statements.

It's what happens these days.\\n\", u\"\\nI'm sorry to dampen your enthusiasm, Owen, but I think you'll find that there are quite a few people in this country who actually support the idea of a ban on Muslim immigrants. Hundreds of thousands are demonstrating in the USA but an opinion poll supports Trump's ban. Anti-Trump feelings are more widespread in the UK, but I doubt if it would be much different here on this issue.\\nRemember the Farage poster of the march of the refugees? Listen to radio phone-ins and be amazed at the number of seemingly decent people who ring up and complain about Halal school dinners or mosques being built at the end of their street. The reason my neighbour gave for voting Brexit was she thought Britain on its own would be better at dealing with the refugee crisis.\\nThe sad fact is that demonstrations by the usual suspects will achieve nothing. Demonstrations by the usual suspects are a turn-off for the people you need to convert. It won't be until they change their minds, perhaps on an issue that you would consider trivial, like a slight to the Queen, that your movement will have any chance of success.\\n\", u'\\nTo appease a dictator as Trump is turning out to be is always advisable.

But out there with these racist rednecks, it must be a temptation to be god. Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have one. Trump has reached his.

A prominent proto-fascist figure is Gabriele d\\'Annunzio, the Italian nationalist whose politics influenced Benito Mussolini and Italian Fascism.Proto-fascism - Wikipedia.\\nThis might be because as many have pointed out lately- the definition of \\'Fascism\\' is that all opposition is suppressed.Given the mass hysteria all over the place - opposition isn\\'t exactly being suppressed is it?Hence new descriptive term.\\n', u\"\\nGood if it's always good natured.

Allied this to a screaming commitment to any passing cause and you have gibberish. Are you reporting on Trump! No! Just finding new ways to insult him - which the election proved doesn't t work. \\nThe choir will always detest him but you need to explain to the congregation his limitations and perspective. Facts are essential.Mr Trump is an old fashioned wig. A party that existed before the Republican Party existed.It s perspective is protectionism economics. And support for the uk. And war with dodgy foreigners in a limited and pragmatic way. It wants to boost industry and reward industrial workers at home.The democrates want to reduce industry, set up a global economy and export American values across the world. These differences back to the 1820 s. For some years America has been in the midst of a civil war, fought across its bureaucracies. It has also degenerated into a corporatist mafia style of institutionalised criminality. The Hillary/ Trump divide can be seen in this contest.When a country goes through a period of crisis like this it can explode or implode. If Hillary had won the USA would have directed it s confusion outwards and great wars would have ensues. Donald has turned the USA into itself and we see the results. One day it will calm down.A suggestion. Only a really insecure nation drapes itself endlessly in it s flag. And doesn t exaggerate it s historical significance. When America matures, if it survives in it s current state, it will stop endlessly waving it s flag and it will start to see itself in proper perspective in the world. It will mature from its citizens up. The top lot will be the last to catch on. Hope too many folk don t get hurt in the process.

Discuss our issues in private because if the US kick off a trade war with China and we're not in the EU, I can see the cost of living going up dramatically and the pound going down further.\\nTrumps rhetoric and plans are disgusting.

Why aren't you marching on the Bengali embassy who refuse entry to Isrealis? Where was your anger and energy when golden boys Obama and Clinton were bombing or attacking places like Libya and Somalia?\\nIts your rank hypocrisy, double standards and total lack of concern for the lives of ordinary people who dont fall under your special minority blanket that brought you Trump, the Republicans running the entire country, Brexit, Labour's downfall and a Tory government.\\nKeep up your screaming, virtue signalling and outrageous double standards.

I would only add that any transformative movement on the left has to advance a critique and demands unbound by the obsession with personality advanced by the media, including papers like this one. Constant focus on the character of Trump is itself a reproduction of liberal claims about individuality and the dynamics of history That mystify socioeconomic relations as well as the way modern inverted totalitarian sham democracies like the US actually function. And, of course, making it all about a handful of undesirable people currently at the top - even if they are particularly outrageous and corrupt - is mainly of benefit to political opponents who are themselves totally invested in the status quo. Democratic Party strategy at the moment appears defined by doing nothing but waiting until Trump flames out and it is their turn at the steering wheel once more.\\nEach turn of the screw, each piece of deregulation or repression or wealth transfer needs to be pinned not on the venal man in the Oval Office but the totality of conditions that both produces them and they reproduce. This is an anathema to almost all media analysis but it is the only way to remain focused on the causes of the current escalation crises rather than disparate effects.\\nAnd any movement need to rid itself immediately of the tyranny of low expectations that is essentially the defining function of parties like the Democrats. At the Women\\'s March, the portrayal was of a protest for reproductive rights and against the \"wrong sort\" of person being President - these are not the basis of mass mobilising of any kind, but long years of defeat have caused some in the left to internalise them. Owen Jones is often guilty of this himself.\\n', u\"\\nSilent?

What Owen can't accept that we have had a vote to leave the EU, and no, we are not all stupid, it was a vote to leave the single market and customs union, the main features of the EU. America voted for Trump, and shock horror, he is doing what he said he would. I am fully supportive of Trump, he's a breath of fresh air my only regret is that he is not our PM.

I dont want a ban but imagine if 40 years ago all musilms so mainly people from pakistan, bangladesh, somalia had been banned. We would have less terrorism, be better off economically due to the very low income and employment levels of those from those countries and have more integrated communities with better relations. It would be morally wrong to ban them but on a practical sense it would be positive.\\n', u\"\\nYou are a bit mixed up. Protests didn't begin in the US until 1965 when the draft was introduced in 1965, well after JFK died. There were around 16,000 US troops in Vietnam at the time of the JFK assassination. Yes Kennedy increased involvement in Vietnam during his short time in office but many historians now believe he was about to announce a pull-out.\\n\", u\"\\nIt's gesture politics but as an European I feel a message has been sent out after two years of Islamic terrorism having a free bloody reign across significant parts of the Continent. In relative political terms, it is as brutal as what has come before it - including the West's complacency over the Syrian War - but that is where we are.\\n\", u\"\\nMaybe for a single march, but I doubt it. The anti war movement in the states lasted for years - at least three presidential terms and parts of more. I'd like to see that commitment last in this era, but I doubt people have the stamina.\\n\", u\"\\nI'd suspect that the protestors in the US are not representative of the majority of Americans and certainly not those who voted for Trump.

Take a step back and listen to yourself will you!\\nFirstly we are among the last countries to be able to take any kind of moral high ground considering our history (both distant and recent). So that's laughable on its own.\\nBut then when you factor in Brexit and leaving the EU single market, it just makes this whole suggestion become beyond ludicrous. I know the chances of a good trade deal are slim, but if we all of a sudden try to become some kind of moral pariah and piss him off, then the chances go from slim to zero.\\nAnd just to do some hypothesizing.... Let's say our PM does do 'the right thing' and stands up to Trump.... Then what? \\nWill Trump cease to be president without our 'validation'? Will he alter even one of his policies because the mighty & righteous UK has said they don't agree? Will all the people in the world who's countries have been wronged by our past indiscretions suddenly think we're not an outdated odious colonial ex-power anymore?\\nIf you answered yes to any of the questions above, you need to remove your head from your ass.\\nThe truth is if we follow this Journos advice we will slip even further into obscurity and our economy looks even more doomed than it already does.\\nSorry for the length by the way....

Falsely characterising half the population as racists is no way to build a successful resistance to Trump. \\nOn that subject, I feel Owen is making a mistake linking his coalition against Trump to a pro-EU website.

I don't think so, even if some of the trolls on this thread would like it that way.\\n\", u'\\nActually he can. If he does then he will be punished for so doing.

A nationalist protectionist who has shown himself to be totally opposed to trade and its benefits? A man who has made it clear that he thinks all deals are just like his real estate deals, a zero-sum game with a winner and a loser? You'll forgive me if I don't hold my breath for a favourable trade deal with the US on his watch.\\nAnd moreover, the way we are rushing to Trump's side at such a controversial time is not only foolish, it is unseemly. We can afford to wait a few months to see how Trump turns out and perhaps save a little face. It seems to me at the moment we look utterly, utterly desperate and are doing an excellent job alienating the European countries we will need to strike a deal with over two short years.\\n\", u\"\\nAccording to latest US poll - 48% of US citizens support the ban of refugees and people from certain countries, while 42% oppose it.\\nSo good to see people power, that the left's protest cheerleaders crow on about, winning the day again!

May's only mandate comes from the lack of any serious opposition (history will judge the labour party of this period very harshly). \\nWill he do foul things? Yes, of course. That was why he is popular. The American working classes are suffering. They know that he is not going to do too much to ease their pain, but he will make them feel better by hurting others. Oddly, he might be the one to give more momentum to the anti-gloablisation trend. His crude brash approach will probably work better with tax and responsibility dodging global companies than normal approaches.\\nIs he the worst? Too early to say. He may run out of steam.

Reagan did a lot of harm, not least the thousands of people who died from AIDS due to his deliberate neglect. \\nShould we do business with him?

With or without Brexit, the European project is doomed. it has been suffocated by self-serving bureaucrats, corruption and a refusal to decide between closer economic union and political expansion. \\nWhat should we do?

Sorry, its the old adage, I may utterly disagree with your point of view, but I will defend your right to have it ... instead we are asked instead to demand tit for tat acts are the best way to deal with this?? Sorry, that's pathetic.\\n\", u'\\nAs an Attorney General her job was to uphold the law and the constitution, not rubber stamp anything the President does.\\n', u\"\\nHere is the press coverage of the immigration ban defending Obama's immigration ban policy for Iraqis in 2001.\\n\\nWhy comparing Trump's and Obama's immigration restrictions is flawed Firstly in 2011, there was a specific threat from Iraqis. Second, the scope of the two policies is slightly different.\\n How tenuous an argument is that. 90% of the people demonstrating don't even know what they are demonstrating against. Just Trump in general I guess. Pathetic. isn't it Owen.\\n\", u\"\\nBecause no one thought he would do something as ridiculous as this. Neither did we think he would openly embrace torture - not even his own party.\\nYour hindsight don't count.\\n\", u'\\nCool story, bro\\n', u'\\n\"This means disagreements must be voiced in private rather than in public.\"\\nTrump would just Tweet about it anyway...\\n', u\"\\nSo given we increase our risk of dying of heart disease and probably cancer too by eating sugar why doesn't the US ban sugar? Doing so would lengthen many lives in the US. Banning Muslims will increase tension not reduce it, and make Islamic radicals more not less likely to try and mount attacks. Totally idiotic and counterproductive. It makes you wonder whether Trump possesses a brain at all\\n\", u\"\\nEverything's a continuum, though. Using your logic a PM could shut down the media and arrest editors and we could merely say that is a continuation of existing BBFC laws. The 'care and diplomacy and in response to a specific threat' is the important bit.\\n\", u\"\\nInteresting to note the 7 countries on the banned list was formulated by the Obama administration, also it's not a ban on muslims but a ban of known countries with a proven terrorist association. Once again the words Muslim and terrorists are being conflated.\\n\", u'\\n\"stand up to trump\". \\nSorry, I\\'m afraid I\\'ve read too much \"viz\" to take that seriously.\\n', u\"\\nAn odd comment, you seem to think the disquiet over Bush was solely created by the Guardian when the criticism was wide ranging and I think the Chilcott report confirms what a fiasco it was. Equally Bush was roundly criticised in America for his response to the disaster in the southern states - it didn't come just from the Guardian you know! You need to read more widely and not only the British press.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nIs this the vision of our future you had in mind Brexiter? - a new, much reduced Britain as fifties Cuba, an offshore 24 hour casino, a US puppet run by the Tory mafia, the population as livestock or 'in service', the NHS as the chief means of stock management through strategic culling of waste people.\\n\\nHysterical nonesense. And insulting to anyone who lived under the dictatorship of fifties cuba. The claim about the nhs is david ike tier delusional.\\n\\nNo corporate tax, starvation wages, gutted public services,normalized tax evasion and money laundering, government's only duty to preserve the inalienable right of the rich to prey on the weak.\\n\\nStill ridiculous hyperbole, but these issues are all present while we are a member of the eu.\\n\\nI'll take the EU and the single market any day; and welcome lots of educated, multilingual, hardworking immigrants too, thank you very much\\n\\nNothing stopping us getting those while outside the eu: contrary to your dystopia, the uk remains a highly desireable destination for people from around the world. Of course under eu law we also have to accept the lazy, monolingual, racist, poor, ignorant and exploitative migrants as well.\\n\\nOur homegrown stock needs rejuvenation, obviously.\\n\\nGenocide via eugenics? How very progressive.\\n\", u'\\nFor 25 years, almost completely ignored except in relation to the Iraq War, a section of the political Left and a smaller section of the political Right have consistently opposed the racist, militarist and imperialist policies of the Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump Administrations. For 20 years, almost completely ignored except in relation to the Iraq War, a section of the political Left and a smaller section of the political Right have consistently opposed the racist, militarist and imperialist policies of the Blair, Brown, Cameron and May Governments.\\nA steadfast stalwart has been, and remains, Jeremy Corbyn. His election and re-election as Labour Leader have been significant victories for the movement against liberal interventionism. Another victory was the social media campaign that led to the lobbying of the House of Commons such that it defeated the Cameron Government over Syria. Therefore, it is not correct to say that, \\u201cThey never did Stop the War.\\u201d\\nIn the event of a State Visit to the United Kingdom by President Donald Trump, it is imperative that those with that consistent, and not unsuccessful, record be the organisers of what would easily be the largest demonstration in British history, and that that demonstration be addressed by Mr Corbyn. This would have the potential to politicise an entire generation, thereby changing Britain in myriad ways over at least 50 years. But it would have to be led by those who would have reacted in the same way to a State Visit by President Hillary Clinton.\\n', u\"\\nYes, really. Trump and Farage are proto fascists. And I'm no lefty.\\n\", u'\\nWell now if every single Guardian reader turns up with a banner (and a begging bowl for your wages) do you honestly think it will make an iota of difference? I mean really.\\n', u'\\nI must have missed the bit where tens of thousands of Trump supporters dressed up in military uniforms and held mass torchlight rallies in front of the Senate house before marching through Washington smashing windows, beating opponents to death and burning down mosques.\\n', u'\\nThe Don is proving to be an incredible sleeper agent for Brexit and May !\\n\"Don we need a little excitement over the weekend to distract the UK public and keep my Brexit debate stitch up off the front pages\", \"sure no problem Tezza - leave it with me !\"\\nThe rest as they say is history - don\\'t you just love it when a plan comes together !\\n', u'\\nHer resignation would have had more impact (than being fired by that guy).\\n', u\"\\nYesterday at the protest in Downing Street I talked to some people who said to be dismayed with how brexit and trump go hand in hand. Astonished how blindly the people is ready to follow despotic rhetoric believing that it will bring them wealth. I saw signs saying 'do not let history repeat itself', and 'we all know how this ends'. I think we're past the point of no return. It's getting harder and harder for trump apologists to defend his policies and ideology without sounding fascist. Standing quietly with the US will make the UK the oppressor by association, and let's not forget the nazi 'alt-right' movement is well alive in France and Germany as well. They have their eyes on the next elections in Europe, wishing brexit sets fire to their democracies like UKIP did here.\\n\", u'\\nNope\\n', u\"\\nI believe the Women's march(es) attracted more people than anti Vietnam war protests, but I don't know if this is indepedently verified.\\n\", u\"\\nWhe must stay close to the US. It's bigger than its current president. I'd hope nobody shunned us because of our PM. Snowflake tantrums will get us nowhere.\\n\", u'\\nIndeed.\\n\"An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.\"\\n Winston Churchill\\n', u'\\nI love the idea of Sally and Michelle job sharing the role of president. Both are principled and caring, Michelle would have one of the best advisors at home to guide her through the troubles of the US and the rest of the world.\\n', u\"\\nAlso remember that it's not Trump you are fighting against, it's the 48% or so of Americans who voted for him to represent them.\\nMoaning about Trump might be satisfying, he is after all a grotesque and horrible individual, but unless you can address the issues of the people who chose him to represent them all you would achieve in getting rid of Trump would be to replace him with an equally awful alternative.\\n\", u\"\\nNah you won't!\\nYou'll be at home behind your keyboard acting hard!\\n\", u'\\n\\nWell, Owen will apparently soon be telling you exactly what you need to do. \\n\"Watch this space\"!!\\n\\nPuts me in mind of Rimmer in this meeting...\\n', u'\\nAlso reminds me of something Rik Mayall would have said in the young ones. \\nEverything and everyone is so crypto facist!\\n', u\"\\nI guess you're leaving to go live on the Continent, then?\\n\", u\"\\nThe president can't instruct people to break the law either.\\n\", u'\\n\\n... and the kind of terrorist who attacked the Quebec mosque?\\n\\nOf course we should invest effort into keeping people safe from homegrown terrorists of any political persuasion; however that is not relevant in this case, unless you wish to introduce deportations, which is absurd.\\n', u'\\nSo to take an extreme example would you have maintained relations with nazi Germany if it was good for trade?\\nI want to know where you will draw the line with Trump?\\n', u\"\\nI went on a demo last night, not to protest about Trump, but to protest against the State visit. I've no objection of him coming for an official visit, but I don't think he should get the red carpet treatment.\\nIts up to Americans to sort out Trump, he's their President not mine (thank God).\\nThat said, its important to show solidarity with the majority of Americans who didn't vote for Trump and are about to see their country ripped apart and basic rights and benefits taken away from them.\\nOur own basic rights and benefits are about to be taken away from us, not by Trump but by leaving the EU and having a Tory Government in power for probably the next 10 years. Lets not get too side tracked.\\n\", u'\\nNo there are not two sides with valid points. On one side is Trump and on the other is everything that is decent.\\n', u'\\nThis is an opinion piece FFS\\n', u\"\\n\\nBecause a: we need a trade deal with everybody, and b: they are the largest single importer of UK goods.\\n\\nPresumably the US is going to want something out of it too. Given it has lower food and consumer standards, won't lowering ours be one of the prices we pay?\\n\", u'\\nSmash the Fash! Open Borders Now!\\n', u\"\\nObama's order did not ban Iraqi immigration, it imposed greater vetting after two Iraqi's found to have been involved in terror acts in Iraq had been allowed to come to the USA. This incurred huge delays, but immigration from Iraq was not stopped. Also, Obama was reacting to an actual threat; Trump isn't, he's merely playing to his base. \\nSee Washington Post article here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/29/trumps-facile-claim-that-his-refugee-policy-is-similar-to-obama-in-2011/?utm_term=.342a152785b2&wpisrc=nl_most-draw16&wpmm=1\\nTrump isn't concerned with US security as if he was, then Egypt & Saudi Arabia (among others) would be included and citizens from those countries have actually committed terror acts in the US. It is thought they're excluded because Trump has business interests there he doesn't want to jeopardise.\\n\", u\"\\nWhere is the outcry and mass protests about other countries who ban people permanently. Trump's ban is for 3 months and still 3 months shorter than Obama's ban. 16 other countries ban people and have done for years now noise off the left tho. All this is about been soar losers about Brexit and Trump in the US.\\n\", u'\\nThe Americans I know do.

What is your alternative, please do tell.\\n', u'\\nA fat and stupid tiger.\\n', u\"\\nOh god, Owen Jones, I feel close to desperation these days. Brexit, now Trump, now the Muslim ban - these are dangerous, very worrying times.\\nAnything you can do - thank you. I will march, I will demonstrate - but under our democratic system, one person gets to be big boss. It's anti democratic that Theresa May has the absolute right to decide things.\\nIf only we had a proper functioning system of government by cabinet debate and vote, rather than one person having so much power.\\nEvery day I think that I must stop reading the news for a while. I'm finding it depressing. I'm losing hope.\\n\", u'\\nThere is no point we can not change anything the fanatics right wing won.\\nJust hope for the best.\\n', u\"\\nThe Japanese have't been chucking bombs into the Middle East either.\\n\", u'\\nAll those who did not pull their weight in the referendum bear the responsibility for the fact we cannot afford to do anything other than fawn around Trump\\nStep forwaard Jeremy Corbyn and all his familiars ..ie Owen Jones\\n', u\"\\nYes!

Be it a slow motion traincrash or something Michael Bay might put in a movie.\\nBut maybe by protesting we can shape the future for the better rather than the even worse.\\n', u'\\nThe same Saudis who paid for anti.Trump campaign.

Trump\\u2019s already <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trumps-travel-ban\" title=\"\">infamous executive order </a>\\u2013 the beginning of the implementation of his <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">explicit pledge to ban Muslims</a> from entering the United States \\u2013 has been widely condemned on constitutional and legal grounds. Yates instructed her department not to enforce the order because she was not \\u201cconvinced that the executive order is lawful\\u201d: and so she was purged.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Many US presidents have been responsible for injustices at home, and even graver injustices abroad. It nonetheless needs repeating \\u2013 until we are blue in the face \\u2013 that this is not a normal president. The usual playbook of opposition does not apply to an authoritarian, bigoted demagogue who does not conform to democratic norms. A proto-fascist will not be defeated by a few rousing renditions of Kumbaya.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>There will be those in Britain who say: this is none of our business \\u2013 Trump is for Americans to deal with. His whopping loss in the popular vote aside, he triumphed in the US election. Americans are not exactly known for appreciating foreigners sticking their noses into their internal affairs, least of all Brits, given the small matter of the war of independence, and the fact that British troops burned down the White House in 1814.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Of course Americans must lead the movement against their president.

This is heartening, and the very least we can do is express our solidarity.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>But we must mobilise, too. Because of Theresa May\\u2019s determination to exit the single market, our prime minister is making a strategic decision to ally with Trump\\u2019s administration. She waltzed off to the White House almost as soon as he\\u2019d moved in, played a sycophant, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\" title=\"\">held hands with him</a>, praised him for offering his country renewal, then refused to promptly speak out against his executive order, even when her own citizens had been targeted.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>\\u201cWe will be offered a favourable trade deal!\\u201d the government says about a US president whose new defining slogan is \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d. \\u201cWe will restrain him!\\u201d they say, just as was naively said about Tony Blair and George W Bush. The fact is, Britain is being used to legitimise and normalise the president. Our weak, cowardly government is turning our country into a useful prop for Trump.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>How demeaning of our country, to be reduced to a patsy for a racist demagogue.

If the refugee problem was not so serious, I would laugh.The descendants of the people that dispossessed the aboriginals cannot find it in their heart to accept genuine refugees into their vast country. Instead they want America to accept them. This is hypocrisy of the highest order.\\n\", u'\\nFair enough Christina I think you have nailed it and I agree that Turnbull is struggling. You were Premier of NSW when Australia was under attack from the Rudd / Gillard disaster which we know now has left us broke. What did you say when Gillard gave us a carbon tax that sent power prices skyward? (lets not speak poorly of the sisterhood) What did you say about Labor abolishing a working border protection policy resulting in 100.000 plus people that turned up on boats swamping our borders and draining our future savings? What about Swans surplus that will never came and has now turned into a multi generation debt a thon. Yes we do need a leader and Turnbull is not he and neither is little Bill, can anybody tell me who is?\\n', u'\\nIs it happening with all our long established pollies. ALP, greens and lib. They are all old hat move within their comfort zone have no guts to stand and listen to the people of the country- may upset some worthless money earning world wide organisation ..If a worker is not full filling his position efficiently he is sacked .Ffor the wages and rip offs they are costing us they should be sacked.

The craven response of the others is demoralising.\\n', u\"\\nMy apologies. It's the exasperated response of one who is sick of seeing a certain group bullied, vilified and dehumanised. I read the Quadrant article. I wish I hadn't. \\nMaybe if you actually knew some Muslims, you wouldn't be manipulated by these arseholes from Quadrant.\\n\", u'\\nWhen you sup with the devil us a long spoon. Trump is the devil and if you think you\\'ve seen the worst from him think again, you aint\\' seen nothing yet. He listens to no one but himself and those who agree with him.Disgraceful as it was to behave towards another country\\'s Prime Minister as he behaved towards \"Tax dodger\" Mal, reportedly hanging the phone up on him, then tweeting to show him to be lying. You cannot help but smile that the country\\'s LNP Prime Minister is treated with the kind of contempt his Ministers treat everyone else with, and from the US President who\\'s election they treated as the second coming.\\n', u\"\\nFor the sake of the world this entire cabal should be hanging in Nuremberg already. But instead we'll let them destroy the world so a few fuckwits get their temporary power trip.\\n\", u'\\nUS Citizen here. The author has it spot on. Let\\'s be really clear about Trump and his administration. Trump lies almost constantly. When he is bragging about his accomplishments he is lying. The ONLY time he isn\\'t lying is when he is threatening other people. He promised to wage a Presidency on the politics of fear of vindictiveness, and he promised he would allow Putin to do whatever he wants. As the saying goes, believe the autocrat. \\nAll Australia, or any ally including May, will get from Trump is this, \"The US can still honour the commitment and not take a single person from these offshore facilities. This puts Australia in the worst possible position: selling our silence and getting nothing in return.\" Trump will go out of his way to humiliate Australia and the rest of our old allies. Why? Who the hell knows. \\nIf you want to help us and yourselves then reject all conversations with Trump. Don\\'t take his calls. Don\\'t meet with him. And for God\\'s sake don\\'t invite him to meet your monarch. Only a fool would do that. \\nI\\'m sorry we have done this to you. Beers are on us when this nightmare is over.\\n', u\"\\nYes well, I used to think that we had some values but I'm seriously beginning to doubt that. \\nFizza's willing to pay for his job ( will get it back in tax) but quite happy to drive those needing welfare assistance to a sufficient degree of despair so that directions to Life Line are given with enquiries to those seeking to sort out their wrongly issued demand notices. \\nThen he attempts to deflect questions about his donations to a spin about the ALP being funded by the Trades Unions, while not mentioning that it's because of the Unions and the working people who founded them, that the unions exist to peruse the interests of ordinary people. Just as the Lib Nats were also founded by self interested groups and individuals to pursue their agendas. \\nThroughly sick of the IPA...LNP and all that they represent. The right wing of the ALP are giving me a serious dose as well. Neither represent my values sufficiently any more and nor do any of the other options.\\n\", u'\\nNO BLOODY NERVE\\n', u'\\nThanks\\n', u'\\nIts tax deductable he probably will get most of it back...and yeah $5 to the poor man disgusting...this is just exactly the point, politicians totally out of touch.\\n', u'\\nWhen one becomes Prime Minister, does not the Kirrabili House come with the job?...how many Prime Ministers before Turnbull have lived in the that house, like most of them...so Malcolm stop making excuses why you contributed 1.75 million to your party and turning the attention on Bill Shorten...um it still does not mean you are a greater leader, because you are definately not..\\n', u'\\nYes, it it true, Malcolm Turnbull will be generous with his money into thinks he believes in - $1.75million into the Liberal Party and $5 into the hands of a poor unfortunate man on the street.\\n', u\"\\nAt least Turnbull pays for what he believes in 1.75 million for a born to rule mentality. Paying 1.75 million and his own cabinet still can't stand him. Well done that man.\\n\", u'\\nWow...what are you on? I want some!\\n', u\"\\n...if you're good....\\n\", u'\\nI said \"many\".\\n', u'\\nMister SmileyFace just keeps beaming big ones...offers nothing else...\\n', u\"\\nWho pulls the plug on 'comments' ?

There's also the issue of moral copyright.\\n\", u\"\\nAfter a highly successful career and bags of money Malcolm Turnbull determined on a career in politics. Why? Social cachet? To add to his CV? I don't wish to be rude but all the man has achieved as PM is to have become a 'Lame Duck' leader. If this was Rome he would have fallen on his sword. And all that the electorate has is a rejuvenated DLP running the country with Malcolm Turnbull acting as a cat's paw. Shame Turnbull, shame.\\n\", u\"\\nForget Kristina's opinion.... get ol' Mark Latham's opinion... would've been better reading\\n\", u\"\\nIf I only knew I would be a wealthy man!\\nActually I wasn't spot on, I missed the waffle being composed of talking in clich\\xe9 after clich\\xe9 just like Sir Desmond Glaysbrook, Jim Hacker's talentless candidate for head of the Bank of England in Yes Prime Minister; a TV show that pre curses our current government so accurately its frightening.\\nOne day Fizza will have something worthwhile to say and won't care about the rest of the Tories as he says it.\\n\", u'\\nWhat are your values then? Or are you afraid to express them because people may judge you for what you are?\\n', u'\\nHow is it that Turnbull can brings himself into further disrepute by not simply saying how much he donated to the Liberals - talk about fouling your nest.\\n', u'\\nThe knives are weighing him down it appears Lucy has the balls in the family\\n', u'\\nLike the little boy says: \\'it\\'s a scam\"\\n', u'\\nI watched a number of interviews with Trump\\'s homebase last year by different network programs.

I don\\'t see him as being a dangerous tyrant due to congress and and compartmentalisation of state assets.\\n', u'\\nAccording to figures on vote Compass in the run-up to the July2, 2016 Federal Election the top issue for Coalition voters was the economy 37%, for Labor education 24% and healthcare 22% and the Greens the environment 34%. \\nPaul R Ehrlich, best known for his early warnings about the impact of population growth and impacts of resource mismanagement on global sustainability, about 3 to 4 years ago on ABC The Drum stunned the panel when he said he could not understand why Australia was not capitalising on value add steel production.... obviously saw greater overall global positives as against domestic negatives.\\nThere is one Australian globally recognised large scale infrastructure project that can bridge the combined expectations of voters in all three major parties whilst bridging the two speed economy: the privately funded EWLP $55 billion Project Iron Boomerang ...http://www.eastwestlineparks.com.au/ .....look in media library, contributing $88 billion to GDP and additional tax revenue of $22billion annually from 2022 onwards according to RACQ QLD; enabling the creation of major diversified job opportunities; accelerating the shutdown of ZOMBIE steel mills around the world; maintaining a competitive edge for established blue collar industries by producing the cheapest high quality slab steel in the world irrespective of whether commodity prices are high or low; generate major home grown global carbon credits utilised with a cap and trade ETS to grow renewable technology opportunities with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation( CEFC); the ability to reduce debt and deficit in forward projections whilst helping to pay for the increased costs of education and health along with greater protection for the Great Barrier Reef when compared with the alternative option of the massive Adani Carmichael thermal coal mine and other new coal mines in QLD.\\nBusiness and Environmental sustainability:\\n1)Ships leaving and returning to Port Hedland WA and Abbot Point QLD 1/3 rd the size of bulk iron ore and coal carriers \\u2013 with large savings in CO2 emissions in transport and production efficiencies. Ships return with imports not empty space. Ships contain solid product and do not export by-products like raw material waste which would give better protection to the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef if there were to be a shipping disaster. The production of heat from a steel mill can be utilized to generate electricity for housing and ancillary industry like in recycling of electronics and motor vehicles(eg. tyres)2) CO2 emissions globally do not recognize national or international boundaries \\u2013 the primary cause of coral bleaching, acidification and warming of both the oceans and land surfaces. If you can knock out highly polluting and cost inefficient steel mills around the world and not just in China by eliminating 3 per cent of global ZOMBIE production of steel slab would not this be a positive in attempts to reduce global warming?3) If you can set up Australia as a global power in renewable energy supply would you not grab the opportunity? Project Iron Boomerang would provide the rationale for a circular national electricity grid with greater renewable energy input, connecting NT, SA, VIC, NSW, ACT and QLD, enabled by electrified rail and large scale solar thermal and geothermal base-load electricity with the aid of battery storage in central Australia \\u2013 with extension via rail corridors to Port Hedland WA and in combination with undersea cable to Indonesia and Tasmania4) Don\\u2019t think just carbon capture and storage think utilization \\u2013 where there are opportunities for bio-fuel production in both QLD and WA. In central Australia there is the opportunity to boost the commercial viability of geothermal electricity production by combining it with carbon capture and storage as demonstrated in Iceland by combining water, CO2 and extreme heat to produce stone.5) Project Iron Boomerang provides the mechanism for the utilization of natural gas which does not involve fracking, with a 3,300km rail corridor straddling northern Australia providing gas pipeline connection to all existing gas pipelines in Australia together with very fast optic fibre internet broadband communication.6) CSIRO researchers believe in the not too distant future they can substantially reduce CO2 emissions from the burning of metallurgical coal. Steel mills can be set up to accommodate hydrogen power but don\\u2019t expect that to be commercially or environmentally viable any time soon. Unlike electricity power generation where there are real renewable opportunities as against fossil fuels eg micro-grids using a combination of wave and tidal power (Carnegie Wave Energy Limited), solar cooling systems, solar thermal, roof top solar PVC and wind with battery storage there are no real commercial options currently for indispensable steel.\\n', u'\\nWell - please leave our community immediately and live by yourself, where no-one else has to prescribe to your values.\\nOtherwise - accept the benefits of living in a community with a broad range of common values.\\n', u'\\nWell said Ms Keneally.\\n Your statement \"it is more reason Turnbull needs to stand for his core beliefs\" unfortunately presupposes that either he or the LNP ever had \\'core beliefs\\' other than \"get into government\\'.\\n', u\"\\nYou were spot on.What's going to win her 3.30 this afternoon?\\n\", u'\\nWhere are the leaders?

Of course politicians must listen however, their role ought to be to advance an agenda in the interests of all of us in good faith not simply to pick up on \"the alternative facts\" relied upon by the masses to form an ill informed opinion.

It doesn't however effect our national security in anyway. We aren't going to follow Malaysia into a war on the left bank because some insulted Israelite blew himself up under the Petronas towers. We expect more from America because they tell us and the rest of the world that they are the best country in the world, that they are the beacon of democracy and human rights protections. Yet its actions speak otherwise. If our PM hasn't the balls to speak up or the intelligence to recognise the danger of not speaking up then he isn't fit for the role. \\nHe is playing the docile little ally for two reasons: 1. to make sure they honour the refugee deal, and 2. in the hope that the Transpacific Trade Agreement will still hold once all the focus is off the White House. So he is effectively sentencing the asylum seekers to more uncertainty and probable delay and selling out Australian jobs by not calling out a racist administration on its dangerous behaviour. \\nWell won't he be the toast of Rose Bay!!! Hoorah!!\\n\", u'\\nWe are told often by our political leaders that Australia\\u2019s greatest asset is its people. It follows that proper resource funding of childcare and staff capabilities is critical to the early development of universal equality and opportunities which form the bedrock of learning that lasts a lifetime. BUT why start with cuts to family payments...families who are already struggling with the threat of job losses, unaffordable housing, rising cost of living pressures and static wage growth?\\nPleonexia is alive and well in corporate Australia. Many of the most profitable US corporations pay little or no company tax in Australia despite generating billions of dollars in profit \\u2013 the tax code is too complex and riddled with loopholes \\u2013 and the Australian government appears to be powerless to do anything about it.\\nIn December 2015 it was reported in the media that half of Australia\\u2019s 1300 public companies are under Australian Tax Office (ATO) Review \\u2013 600 major corporations did not pay tax in the 2013-14 financial year.\\nWhy not impose a 1.5 per cent paid parental leave levy on Australia\\u2019s largest companies targeted at affordable childcare as originally proposed by a Federal LNP Abbott government? \\u2013 forget about Australia\\u2019s 3,000 biggest businesses being \\u201cno worse off\\u201d as many obviously do not need the $50 billion in LNP company tax cuts which favour the \\u2018big end of town\\u2019 who already pay minimal tax.\\n', u'\\nThing is Christina, your values, no matter how virtuous you may think them, may not be my values.\\n', u'\\nI feel very sorry for you, if that is your belief, but whinging about it or name calling of \"fantasists\" is not going to solve what you seem to see as the situation. \\nBy remaining silent or merely complaining about the state of values is the same sin as the Fizzer is committing. It is up to each and everyone of us to speak out strongly to those around us and our politicians when we hear or see words or acts that violate our values. What are you going to do to create change?\\n', u'\\nBut they won.\\nWe need to accept the fact that these policies are unbelievably popular with a big chunk of voters. A get-you-elected number of voters. \\nSince Brexit, since Trump and, to a lesser extent, since the Australian election, people have been trying to argue over the numbers as if they don\\'t count. Sure not everyone voted in the UK and sure the US voting system is rigged, but under whatever system was in place the \"bad guys\" won.\\nA large part of Turnball\\'s lack of popularity is also down to him not being extreme enough. Think about that.\\nWhat I think a lot of this is about denial. We want to pretend that there aren\\'t that many arse holes in the world. Well, there are. 2016 proves that. \\nSo the question really is what do we do if there are so many arse holes in the world.\\n', u'\\nTwo separate issues, though.\\n', u\"\\nSomething I'm sure but you can't put a price on getting those people free.\\n\", u'\\nThere\\'s many words to describe the \"ban\" including racist, ill-conceived, cruel, hypocritical, inflammatory, self-harming, counter-productive or just plain thick.\\nBut one word that I think is appropriate is \"cowardly\".

That\\'s taking the easy, cowards way out.\\nIt is far braver to protect the many even, and it must be said, even if a small number are a threat. \\nThese are supposed to be these great countries who fought these great wars.

More likely they are disgusted at the wet rag posing as our \"leader\" and giving the world the false impression that we are mostly wimps and sissies. Another suspicion enters this field: Like Trump, who did not put the Arab countries (the strongest supporters and financiers of the various radical terror groups) with whom he has strong personal business connections onto those lists of travel bans - like Trump, what personal interests is Cayman Mal protecting?\\n', u\"\\nMalcolm, you've got the title you've long coveted, now it's time to actually 'do' something...

A true leader would rise above the shackles of divisive factional bondage, instead bringing the party together to follow united. The Fizzer has proven himself completely spineless by grovelling and brown-nosing instead of using the strong words that were needed.\\n', u\"\\nHis actions represent the majority of Aussie voters.

If Trump does not feel the need to stick to any pre-election agreements USA had with Australia then why should Aus? I would insist he removes his military from Northern Australia and USA spy establishments from our shores. They will be the first targets if the idiot POTUS gets the war he wants.

Turnbull is deaf to the opinions of a 'huge number' of Australia (apology for the Trumpism). Australia needs a strong voice internationally as well as at home. I cannot hear one. But this is not only Turnbull's mishandling of a critical situation in the US, I have not heard other politicians voicing our concerns. The government has gagged its members, and the Labor Party is echoing that silence. As the international criticism escalates, it seems Turnbull has tethered his position to the US agreement to take the refugees who Australia wont. At home Turnbull appears unable to show any dominant policy position. He is not listening to the Australian people nor reading the overseas newspapers. The PMs future seems bleak. He has to go. His colleagues are less willing to support him. There problem though is finding an alternate leader. They have none. Turnbull is in for a very rough ride this year.\\n\", u'\\nTimmy is so mindlessly besotted with his Royal Highness, King Turnbull the Last, that he will not even notice as he is loaded into the tumbril along with the other idiot sycophants.\\n', u'\\nreally what a dumb thing to say all politicians eventually go for any number of reasons. Grow a brain\\n', u\"\\nbut you haven't and she has so your argument is mute\\n\", u\"\\nHe's a coward just like every other right winger. Deep down they're all just longing for an authoritarian demagogue like Trump to wrap them up all snug and tight in the uncomplex and comfortingly dictatorial world of a fascist state. Black and white, might is right, morality merely a matter of absorbing and repeating empty state propaganda dressed up in satisfyingly patriotic rhetoric. No difficult decisions or complex thoughts, Daddy will do all that for you.\\nWatch as the American right rolls right over for a fascist strongman's puppet so they never to suffer the difficulty of critical independent though again, ours would do the same in a heartbeat.\\n\", u\"\\nSo you're saying it's open interpretation if the US administration have already given permission to enter and are half way there. Got it.\\n\", u\"\\nMr Turnbull perhaps could be advised to remember that he is our Prime Minister and not Mr Trumps private and confidential legal adviser. As Prime Minister he is there to represent the Australian people and our values and policies. And in that role he has to be seen to be doing so.\\nPrivate advice has its place. And so also does a public statement of principles, and of calling out something that is wrong.\\nThere is much about the causes of the current fashionable trends in protectionist, xenophobic attitudes that is reminiscent of the 1930's. The last thing we need is for good people to do nothing to a) fix the causes and b) call out and object publically (as well as privately) to protectionist and xenophobic emotions and attitudes.\\nFinally, Mr Trump's behaviour is that of a bully. Appeasing and being nice to bullies never pays off. You have to stand up to bullies.\\n\", u'\\nGeorge Christensen, Cory Bernardi and Pauline Hanson will be running the country......++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++OMG!\\n', u\"\\nhe is breaking the law. You're missing the point. You should be concerned about a president who fires an advisor for disputing the legality of his actions. you should be concerned about a president who blacklists entire communities base on the origin of their birth. you should be concerned that a president who bans the entry of entire populations despite the fact that terrorists are typically nationals. you should be concerned about a president who has rattled his own party and leaders globally. you should be concerned about a president who has engaged his pals and family members (who know little about foreign affairs). all these are the hall marks of a third world dictator entirely out of his depth. he is not going to make you safer or richer. he's a dumb tyrant. suck it up\\n\", u'\\nThey cant send any new arrivals to manus any more anyway.\\n', u'\\nNote that Manus is shut as a deterrent- nobody new can be sent there.\\n', u'\\n\"Its popular so its right\"?

People who live in glass houses, shouldn't throw stones! Interesting spelling of 'policy' btw (alternative spelling... for a police state?).\\n\", u'\\n\"Fizza\" Turnbull has long gone past his personal use-by-date.

His interim caretaker replacement will limp along to defeat at the next election which I expect to be held around March 2019 - if not before - half Senate seats expire on 30th June, 2019.\\nWhat an absolute waste of potential for constructive progress the LNP have been since September, 2013. Zero achievement all round.\\nAn abundance of wasted opportunities - but bigotry, and prejudices were somewhat satisfied for LNP voters.\\nThanks Australian voters - one day you might learn to properly think things through - along with the future consequences of your vote.\\n', u'\\nbeautiful.\\n', u\"\\nIndeed. It's a moral perversity that someone like Turnbull, who's personal wealth is in the 100's of millions, can claim tax payer funded entitlements to the day he's picking the daisies. And what has he actually, really, materially done to be rewarded this way? Nothing. It's more than a perversity, it's an obscenity. \\nPoverty in my electorate is deepening, there are fewer jobs than ever, wages are low and stagnating, people working 2 or 3 casual jobs just to pay the rent, and then go the Salvos for food vouchers...and it goes on.\\nbut then Turnbull and his ilk are completely unprincipled and shameless to boot.\\nHis silence will become deafening roar when history comes to judge him and his administration.\\n\", u'\\nI wonder how he shits without a colon\\n', u\"\\nTurnbull is so desperate to hold on to power, he'd don a dress and lipstick and perform oral sex on the whole cabinet if that was the price to be paid.\\n\", u\"\\nWe'll find out in March if that is the case.\\n\", u'\\n\"The Germans explaining this to the US, now there\\'s a turning point.\"\\nThey had to learn the hard way which is why, generally, they are good global citizens. 70 years on and they haven\\'t invaded anyone.\\n', u\"\\nPlus he's allowing his MPs to increase their bank accounts at the taxpayers expense.Julie BIshop for example.She's been in America for the last 10 days or so at GDay USA with her boyfriend.Last year at the same event she spent over $99,000.00.

Personally I think not. It doesn't matter who the LNP put up as PM if they roll Turnbull, none of them will be prepared to overly critical of the Trump regime - none of them.\\n\", u\"\\nA PM of a country, which doesn't care about the Geneve - Convention about refugees a bit, shall suddenly criticize this American polizy?Hold on!\\n\", u\"\\n\\nMalcolm Turnbull is now living on his knees. He is a man afraid \\u2013 fearful of his backbench, fearful of the polls, fearful of losing his so-called \\u201crefugee deal\\u201d with the United States.\\n\\nIndeed, Malcolm's balls have been in a jar on his bedside table since he became PM.\\n\", u'\\nKristina, the problem with the \"standing up for OUR values\" is that it implies that Australians are thinking and acting as a single unit rather than a mass of individuals. When you have individuals you naturally are going to have vastly different opinions and \\'values.\\'\\nI talk to many people, some who think Trump is the epitome of evil, some who think he is the best thing that has happened to the world and some who just don\\'t give a damn.\\nI suspect Malcolm will not openly condemn Trump for many and a varied reasons which also include isolating and offending potential voters who applaud what POTUS Trump is doing. In case you haven\\'t noticed Pauline Hanson has increasing popularity of late and that is making more than one mainstream politician a little bit nervous I suspect.\\nTalking with like minded people and taking that as gospel and a representative of how a majority of voting public \"must\" think was Hillary\\'s mistake. As unpalatable as it is to sections of the public, there are obviously many who do like both Trump; Hanson; George and Cory to vote for them. Ignoring those people or dismissing them will not change anything either.\\n', u\"\\nWell you're here too. The Guardian seems to pose few limitations on comment size, so feel free to cut loose - or is this all that you have to say on the matter?\\n\", u'\\nNicely done : )\\n', u'\\nOnly the refugees will be screwed. Trump will detain and deport them. If not shoot them.\\n', u'\\nNo doubt you support paying 10 billion a year for detention and tow backs too.\\n', u\"\\nObama's list. That's getting a ton of airplay right now.  No seeming inconsistency with President Muppett who claims: - to be really smart - have access to unique privileged information - know better than the intelligence community what's really going on - will be able to outline the full story Tuesday next week.  But he can't do anything beyond whatever Obama's team identified, for now? I can see why his spokeszombies are so desperately trying to keep control of the media over this. When Trump's trusting devotees start to question what and who he is, it's going to unzip, big time.\\n\", u'\\nAustralia takes in many thousands of refugees every year, many of the people in Manus and Nauru have either refused to be assessed or have been found to not be genuine refugees. They have always been free to leave at any time, but not to come to Australia.\\n', u'\\nThey never did stop the boats like they claim, they just lied. A boat arrival on Xmas island doesn\\'t count anymore when it did when it was a \"labor boat\".nearly all boats only ever arrived on Xmas. Clearly your simple and eat up conservatives lies.\\n', u'\\nHow coukd Australia possibly be taken seriously if they criticized Trump. They have a refugee policy many times harsher than trump. Right now Australia has refugees languishing in offshore camps. \\nIf Australias gave a shit theyd be protesting themselves. The refugee deal is totally ridiculous. Ive never seen an \" ally\" so blatantly try to screw another ally. Australia should be forced to take those people.\\n', u\"\\nI would be able to make up my mind if I could understand the end game here...what is it we are trying to achieve? I do believe we should help genuine refugees, but I also believe we are being played fro mugs by some middle class Muslims who come as refugees then take a holiday back in their own country after saying they are in fear of their lives.\\nI also understand there are many different Muslims who believe different things, so it is wise to sort out exactly who is who and not just scream racism, because it is necessary to do this.\\nI also believe we take refugees because of our helping hand values, but if we have no way of assessing what the outcome will be or if people we have taken in start behaving badly they should be sent back as they obviously did not appreciate the generosity of the country that took them in.However, I do not think anyone can demand we do or not do anything, because that will go down like a lead Balloon.People in western countries have seen their citizens run over with trucks, shot in their work places, stabbed in the streets, blown up with bombs, planes flown into their buildings, people shot wile eating their lunch and held hostage, shot wile watching a band play, seen numerous people arrested before they have attacked, blown up waiting for a plane...and yet, some people are irate that we want someone to at least be doing something.Is it better to hurt someones feelings, than to be scraping the innocent dead from the streets, or carry on and pretend horrible attacks are a part of life now? that is the question, and no one has convinced me what the right thing to do is.But one thing I'm absolutely certain of...we should not base our actions on whether it will create more Islamic terrorists, that is falling prey to an insidious type of blackmail.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump made promises . Went to an election and won it . Now he is honoring his promises .That's what I call a moral compass.\\n\", u\"\\nWrong on pretty much every point. But let's just start with your first one: It's the left that has an issue with all of this...  Some of the more outspoken critics of Trump's recent edicts are Republicans. Like John McCain. Is he a lefty, do you suppose? The annointed Republican 2008 presidential candidate?  Winning an election is like a marriage ceremony: It's heady stuff, and everyone gets dressed up and wishes everyone else all the best. But actually governing, like actual married life, cannot avoid reality. And reality for the US President includes remaining within the law and, particularly, within the Constitution of the USA.  How is that looking right now?\\n\", u'\\nNo. He should step down and hand over to Abbott.\\n', u\"\\nThe Telegraph like all Murdochs city papers are for people who don't give a damn or can't be arsed to get involved so they get these comics stuffed full of useless nonsense about big arsed Kardashians, over paid sports people and an endless supply of trivia.\\n\", u'\\nThis is the same kind of leftist hysteria we had when they pursed their lips , wagged their fingers and cried in shrill alarm , \"You can\\'t stop the boats! That would be terrible !You must not stop the boats! Anyway... they can\\'t be stopped. \"The left are in dismay because Trump has affirmed the legitimacy of the nation state . In doing so he has he has crushed for a lifetime the odd idea that we can live in a world without borders.The US has taken control of its borders and demanded of asylum seekers : show us your papers !\\n', u'\\nAnd then what? You see the problem, right?\\n', u'\\nObama made the list actually.\\n', u'\\nI didn\\'t write this, credit belongs to another Guardianista from a year or two back. The scenario is persuading the Australian electorate to swallow a shit sandwich, just before and after Abbott\\'s demise.  Tony was consistently brief, and to the point:  \"Shit is good, it\\'s good and you should have it. It\\'s good for you, it\\'s good for me. So let me say, shit is good, it\\'s very, very good.\"  Now observe Malcolm:  \"Now, let me just say a little bit about this sandwich. It\\'s something we can have a conversation about. It\\'s not about me, but I can bring you along with me and we can begin to understand the policy stance associated with it and the benefits that will ensue upon the ingestion of what can only be described as quality excreta. Now it\\'s not for me to prevail upon you to undertake this action, but by collaborating with us in this exciting adventure I\\'m sure you will realise the fundamental genius of what this sandwich, this sandwich of rare manures, represents.\"\\n', u'\\nActually Kristina what the country needs is for Malcolm to resign as he simply is no better at being PM than Abbott was. Enough is enough.\\n', u'\\nLet me explain the Geneva Conventions to you;the claimants must be genuine refugees and they may be scrutinised and assessed by the country from which they claim asylum .\\n', u'\\nIt\\'s the left that is protesting Trump\\'s agenda. If I\\'ve got it right, and correct me if I\\'m wrong, the left lost the election in the USA. And, correct me if I\\'m wrong, but the \"basic tenets of western democracy\" means that power shifts politically without civil war. God help us all if the right starts to mimic the left in unseemly demonstrations. Remember 1848.\\n', u\"\\nYes, and we don't need a leader who holds idiotically preposterous ten-flag adorned press conferences, either.\\n\", u'\\nMalcolm Turnbull is a useless leader.

We, in Australia, do not have a leader either prepared to, or courageous enough, to tell us those soothing words we need to hear, \"It will be all right\", and mean it. Mean it, by changing the current austere system of inequality - race, religion, and economics - so much needs to be done, and can be done. World famous economists (who would have thought?) have been telling us for years what we need to do, and we can. There is no political will from any politician currently living in Australia that I can see. Do you know of any alternative?\\n', u\"\\nThe Australia that I believe in has values.  They're particularly well articulated by the likes of Stan Grant and Waleed Aly, and pretty much the same as the ones that my very anglo-saxon grandfather espoused - and fought to defend, in the trenches of France in 1916.  As a guide, they include basic human decency, respect, and a fair go.  I get that Australia isn't exactly the beacon of leadership right now, but just because we have a bunch of vindictive and selfish politicians doesn't mean that Australia is a different place.

A war waged politically, ideologically, criminally and with violence.\\n', u'\\nIt took us in the UK about 2-3 days to actually make anything close to a criticism of the policy.

Soon after the e people realized he wasn't the great white hope. Then he won an election by the skin of his teeth and has continued to plummet in the polls ever since. It is now quite obvious to all intelligent observers that what we thought he had lost as a leader he never actually had. Keneally has summed it up beautifully. Turnbull is so consumed with his own survival that he has sacrificed any leadership credentials he may have had in an effort to save his own career.\\n\", u'\\nSome coherent English would be good.French even.\\n', u\"\\nDon't forget Julie BIshop.

Trump may be an embarrassment, or a reminder of how important our compulsory voting is (I think both, in reverse order), but he isn't here, or ours.

The \"pull factor\" is the same once they have been moved off Nauru and Manus, whether it is to the US or Australia. It is you who is inferring this means we have to retain Nauru and Manus as a deterrent. Turnbull is clearly not concerned about the \"pull factor\" if he is prepared to send them to the US, so he is effectively saying the camps are no longer serving a purpose because the boats have been stopped by other means.\\n', u'\\nphew! yep!\\n', u\"\\nLabor can't.

Why pursue power as he has for so long if he fails to exercise it well, or encourage those others who might?\\nIt is not hyperbole to say that this is the moment in the history of the USA and it's allies which will - in future generations - be regarded and judged just as the rise of Hilter and all the other crackpot authoritarians was in their regions. How can his conscious tolerate being - not Hilter perhaps - but the awkward 'who me' shrugging fool who fails to completely, and publically, to condemn such an obvious threat, and in doing so rolls over and enables the spread of this thug rule to his own country [witness Morrisons cowardly, opportunistic response to Trumps Muslim ban] .\\nDoes he really not understand, that at this point, it is about the long game and preventing disaster and rallying people.

Read about the history of Byzantium and the middle east and you can see how a once great region has been reduced to the vile, oppressive hell it now is: because of Islam. The so called Islamic Golden period was the last great push of the people in this region before Islam became truly ingrained and left them ignorant and helpless, submitted to the will of \"God\". The Persians were a once great people. The people of what is now Iraq shaped our world. The problem with Islam is that it is a Literal set of dictates by a calculated psychopath. Most other religions, are more of an abstraction including christianity (leviticus and other old testament bits excluded), buddhism etc. However, if any of Mohammad\\'s edicts, as they were literally the unfiltered word of god, are to be ignored, then the whole religion becomes baseless as his infallibility is then undermined. Therefore Islam cannot change or be moderated. It can only be utterly rejected. I challenge you to stand up for the rights of the truly oppressed, not just engage in easy moralising. You have to make a tough decision and show some moral fortitude.\\n', u'\\nThanks Smudge\\n', u\"\\nTrump is a glowing, clinical textbook example of a man with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

True.I'm not disagreeing, just bemused by the reaction, even if it appears to be fomented by a Hillary spruiking media.50,00 People went to an Invasion Day Rally in Melbourne last Thursday, by all accounts, a bigger crowd than attended the official Australia Day Marchy.That occurred in spite of most Media commentary although it got a wee bit of media coverage afterwards,It's as if this anti-Trump media blitz is to distract us from something else.\\n\", u'\\noh braddybear... you really make my daySuch incisive reflections\\nLOL\\n', u'\\nWell said. Australians constantly crow that the country \"punches above its weight\". The country does it in international sports, consistently. Australia also has a proud international military heritage where its citizens have sacrificed above and beyond other countries, per capita. Time to do it once again Mr. Turnbull.\\n', u'\\nMr Turnbull needs to be the leader of all Australia by asserting our core values of equality of opportunity and a thoughtful rebuttal of an American leader who is a parody of a soap opera.\\n', u'\\nMoral Psychology researcher, Jonathan Haidt, has described how people are \\u201cgroupish\\u201d and love to join teams, religions, clubs, political groups etc. When we take on that particular group\\u2019s identity we work towards common goals with others that we may not even know, who are part of the same group. Our human minds seem to be designed for teamwork. Although he describes how human nature is at one level selfish, at another, it is intuitively designed to be groupish. He describes how even criminals will often work together to further their own interests. An unfortunate spin-off is that this intuition of the human mind means that we bind, but also can become blind to the excesses of other group members, particularly those in power positions.\\nYesterday\\u2019s report of: \\u201cBarack Obama breaks silence to encourage protests fighting for US values\\u201d gives an example of how President Trump plays to this \\u201cgroupish\\u201d tendency and offers semi-plausible reasons as to the reason his \\u201cfollowers\\u201d should believe him. When the massive confusion erupted at airports around the world due to his Presidential edict banning people from seven Muslim countries, he sent out a series of Tweets to give his supporters something to hang their hats on, and so not question his wisdom. One example \\u201cOnly 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,....\\u201d was apparently patently false as the Delta computer outage lasted only three hours and occurred 48 hours after his order had come into play. After all, as he Tweeted: \\u201cA lot of bad \"dudes\" out there!\\u201d so gotta be strong!He seems to use this tactic of short, sharp phrases regularly and so keep his supporters with a line of rhetoric that they can use to accept his behaviours. At this stage, they are acting intuitively, and no amount of rational argument will dissuade them from their convictions.\\nAs he Tweets: \\u201cSad..\\u201d\\n', u'\\nIt is by blaming our compatriots we empower the extremists amongst us. Yes, they are often supported by \"ordinary\" folk. However, if we demonise them we choose the wrong target . We allow ourselves to be divided by the spivs , chancers etc. \" Divide and conquer\" is one of the oldest truisms of warfare. Even if we only have one element of similarity, one policy disliked by the majority, then we must unite on that front. When disparate opposition groups come together, disregarding temporarily religious, economic or general philosophical differences in order to achieve a common goal of removing a government we are powerful. Educate, listen to ordinary peoples concerns and find the common ground. If we only talk to one another we\\'re preaching to the converted. This should be the strategy in the US ( especially heading towards the Congressional midterms) as well as here.\\n', u'\\n\\nObama Administration (yes the list of seven countries was actually drawn up under Obama) because a) The United States still imports a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia and b) The United States sells a lot of weapons to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nMy point exactly Sherlock. \"National security\" is a farce.\\n', u\"\\nYour Lordship's support for the vulgarian Trump, lately come to power in The Plantations, is noted.\\n\", u'\\nI get the impression that the media are positioning him.\\n', u\"\\nFormer Australian Prime Ministers have a long and illustrious history of representing AUSTRALIA'S concerns, positions, and overall dismay or acceptance on a given country's political position. It's ironic that the far right of the political spectrum post polling numbers from organisations that they trashed, as recently as November, as a fulcrum supporting the recent executive orders issued by President Trump.\\nIf you believe that 57% of Americans support President Trump you need to put down the rightwing crackpipe and move away from the keyboard.\\nChuckle away you old Burkean! May you be forced to eat the faeces you have created.\\n\", u\"\\nYou're correct. It is a separate state and the US is our strong ally. An ally because we share many 'leftist pixie dust' values: freedom, justice and mercy. Values strong enough to defend in armed conflict. \\nHowever, my opinion differs, starting with the charming (albeit demeaning) reference to pixie dust. This pixie dust is, I'd guess, what inspired Benjamin Franklin, George Washinton et al. (It has more value than house dust, but I'm digressing, and probably to the left.)\\nIs a conscience a liability today? Trump would have me think so. As one astute leader many still revere said: \\n\\nA nation without a conscience is a nation without a soul. A nation without a soul is a nation that cannot live\\n. ( Winston Churchill. )\\nTrump will shake many things up. That can be healthy if people have been left unheard or suffering, or the social contract is no longer working. However, it is a poor outlook for everyone on this basket case of a planet when he seems to have no conscience or even have even a passable understanding of his portfolio (could this possible in 2016?) -- or when Angela Merkel has to ring him and explain the Geneva convention. (The Germans explaining this to the US, now there's a turning point.)\\nAncient Roman Emperors (even Gaius Caligula) were by and large surprisingly competent administrators. But Trump does not even seem to understand his own constitutional laws and it appears he thinks bullying and firing can run a highly intelligent and qualified administration for four years. That might work on TV.\\nI wonder if through his own ignorance of his own country he may have invented a new league. \\nTime and his actions will tell us what kind of league this be, and if people (not him or his cronies) are better off.\\n\", u\"\\nTrump is President by the way, he was recently sworn in, and she didn't simply question his executive order she decided to put her career on the line to make a political point. Good on her but Trump can sack her and he did. She was caretaker so it was a risk I am sure she carefully weighed, presuming she would get fired and elevated to God like status among democratic sympathisers.\\nThe number of people affected by this directly is small in relation to arrivals in the US every day, the inconvenience temporary, but immediately we see the the affronted establishment screaming like little children.\\n\", u\"\\nUnfortunately Turnbull's attitude IS a reflection of the values of many Australians.\\n\", u'\\nAll the paid right-wing commercial media commentariat and their pathetic lot of typically brain-washed talk-back callers are today all TRUMPeting their allegiance to the megalomaniac.

Furthermore, Turnbull does not speak for all Australians and his agreeable stance to The Trump's fascist policy is deplorable. \\nOver the water in the UK, Boris Johnson is floundering under political pressure to be seen to 'do the right thing' and stand firm against The Trump. What does this tell us here in Australia? Basically, we have cretins in charge, who have no idea how to govern effectively, for the wider audience. We should all be quashing The Trump right now; reduce his oxygen, he's a maniac afterall.

If you voted out Labor for \"incompetence\" what would you call the LNP. Mega incompetent? It is still back to voters making ridiculous decisions that have nothing to do with policy or governance.

A future visit with Trump that includes longer term impacts should suffice once he has introduced his new measures and they are starting to perform. Raising concerns is one thing, commenting on events isn't the Australian PM's duty. Just improve the internal decision making to make the best for Australia from changes. He wont budge on his processes as he was voted in on that basis. His own people would not support him just making stuff up then not providing the actions for it.

But the LNP mad right are in a cleft stick on this. If they try to derail the refugee deal, in order to undermine Turnbull, they will appear to criticise Trump, their poster-guy. And the party machine, which wants to look good on refugees.\\nStill, Abbott could take a leaf out of Trump's book and do things that no one thinks he would do, just so that he can wedge Turnbull or anyone else with a bit of sense to their credit.\\n\", u'\\nRemember the smiling selfies on public transport Mal?

Islam is a blight on the face of the planet. Everywhere it is in ascendance (except maybe albania) there is poverty, ignorance, socially sanctioned violence against women = evil. Frankly, Satanism would give a person a greater moral compass than Islam. Anyone who does not despise Islam encourages the denigration of women, animal cruelty, hates rationality and wants eternal chaos, hatred and violence to rule the planet. Let me tell you friends, if you prefer bananas over grapefruit, you are a racist bigot. (Hint: that includes every type of fauna on earth today). Sure, Donald Trump is clearly not cut out for the job, but at least he is not too much of a coward to make an effort to create a bulwark within which secular society can thrive.

If so, he didn't do much 'saving jobs for our kids', just exploited immigrants.\\n\", u'\\nActually Turnbull assisted in the illegal bombing of Syrian cities and armed forces. This under international law is a war crime as it was not sanctioned by the UN security council and neither Australia or their allies were under threat from Syria.This war crime was carried out without the knowledge of the Australian people who are now complicit in the war crimes. Not a word was mentioned by our media, including the ABC and the Guardian that our armed forces were destroying power supplies in Syrian cities which meant no clean water or sewerage services and were deliberately causing a further flood of refugees. To make matters worse this bombing was done under the pretext of helping the Syrian people.

Australia has no use for a prime minister with no convictions.\\n', u'\\nI don\\'t care who he is hemmed in by, he is the PM ffs and should be able to stand up for what\\'s right. If those doing wrong are the powerful then the PM has even more of a duty to speak against it.No wonder the reactionaries and racists are in the ascendancy when their bile can go unchallenged by our leaders.

He is far too soft.\\n\", u'\\nLol.\\n', u'\\nWhat is it - a \"temporary hold\" or a ban?Donald Trump initially arrogantly announced a total ban of people from the countries announced. Now he has been forced to back down and his policy is full of holes.The people stopped from entering America have already been through long security checks and been on \"temporary hold\" so what is its purpose if not purely for race and religion.Interestingly there are countries in the Middle East who are not part of the ban among them Saudia Arabia where Donald Trump does business and the 9/11 terrorists came from.\\n', u'\\nWelcome to the New Age of Fear!

Trump and the rest of the civilized world do have to tackle Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of salafism, an extremist movement within Sunni Islam that advocates a return to the traditions of the \"devout ancestors\" [the salaf], the murderous followers of Muhammad that spread his belief system by the sword.To do so requires an effort akin to the de-Nazification campaign that along with economic reconstruction was conducted in Germany by the Allies after the second world war.People who had been brainwashed by Nazi propaganda were exposed to the murderous realities of the regime - and that included forced visits to concentration camps as well as an education program that exposed the deceptions and lies that were forced upon the population for 12 years. Despite the efforts of die-hards like the werewolf guerrillas, within a short space of time few Germans wanted a return to the years of the Third Reich and in place of Nazi tyranny, a modern democracy emerged - in West Germany at least.Of course the lies and deceit of Islamists may not be so easily undone since Islam has become part of the culture in the lands that were invaded by Muhammad\\'s armies in the 7th Century yet an effective exposure of the crimes of gangs like Islamic State and the Muslim Brotherhood together with a modern education and assistance with economic development would be a far more effective means of combating terrorists than simply locking people up inside their own borders to be exposed to even more virulent propaganda disguised as religious instruction.That is what Turnbull should be saying.\\n', u'\\nThey came for Malcolm Turnbull, but nobody was there.\\n', u'\\nSo Oberon you have in your mind, separated the Muslims from other refugees on Manus and Nauru and called them illegal. What is your basis of calling Muslims illegals and not those of other religions or athiests? Could it be that Trumpian bigotry and illogical thought is caused by a virus that is sweeping through the lowbrow members of our society stultifying their thinking and turning them into jackbooted automatons who despite their mental deficiencies think themselves as being little demigods in their own backyard.\\n', u'\\nMany look away, many hope it will go away. But many will enthusiastically line up to collect their brown shirts. Without them the would-be tyrants would be powerless.\\n', u\"\\nSo says Obeid's jelly fish........bought for a dollar never stood up for anything that wasn't fed to her from behind.\\n\", u\"\\nI can't see much difference in the rules being applied by the President or the PM just a differing approach.

They have been mistreated enough by your Government.You have shunned the proper and humane thing to do in seeing that these people were properly settled in Australia.

The ban has nothing to do with terrorist risk. If it did, The Saudis would have been at the top of Trump's list. \\nWe need politicians in Australia with the brains to analyse the regional power machinations and describe the situation correctly.\\nWe also need public servants in Australia with the moral strength shown by Sally Yates and others like her in America who have publicly defied Trump's dictatorial executive orders.\\n\", u\"\\nIt is ok, although I reckon the Japanese would like my ilk. Educated and understanding of their right to ignore multi culti pap.

The powers that be did change tack as they destroyed public education and made the armed forces 'voluntary' so that the collateral damage of rich peoples children dying in war was all but eliminated. Even now in poorer areas of the USA a career in the military is just better than abject poverty. Death is just the sublime release.

But we emphatically don't want him back.\\n\", u\"\\nWell we don't expect 'around the world with Malaise tonight', but we would like some in depth waffle free comment from the PRIME MINISTER on Centrestink, the rise of One Nation and a few other uniquely Australian things that you'd think that would be in the interests of the public.\\n\", u\"\\nTheir, their!

Over Reach?  The Howard hit that when they got a majority in the senate. The outcome? He lost his own seat as well as the govt in the 2007 election. \\nOver Reach is a good thing, in the long term.

Think on that - only 25% of people were stupid enough to vote for Trump and believe that he would keep his election promises.\\nIn Australia, we had 28.7% of voters vote for the Liberal Party in the last election and the Liberal Party is the \"first among many\" in the Coalition regime.\\nThis means that both here and in the USA, things are being run by people who only represent about a quarter of the total. And you think that\\'s democratic?\\n', u\"\\nAgreed. Checked all the comments and replies to your post before hitting the keyboard and it looks like Bills got them right and their trolls really rattled. He's really warming to this game now. Will be watching Turnbull's effort tomorrow and I'm guessing (a) he'll get personal and (b) it's all Labor's fault. if he does then 54 - 46 will drop like a stone and he's gone !!Still forecasting a may snap election when he bails out and quits politics and Baird comes on board to save the day because there is no one else electable as PM in the Liberal Party !!\\n\", u'\\nNor ours.\\n', u\"\\n\\nAs for her 'moral vanity trip' really, just explain what you mean.\\n\\nAlas it's not my invention. A well worn phrase more or less which a quick Google search can attest to.\\nBut in this case its apt. Kristina is critical of not arguing the case more substantively against Trump but where was she when Obama placed a similar ban on Iraqis during his term? \\nThe thing is, attacking one of her icons is a bridge too far and might get her thrown out of the luvies' brigade whereas Trump is a soft target likely to gain her kudos and acclaim within the noisy circles she performs for.\\n\", u'\\nAs a mum, me and the kids manage to get around just fine without coming across a single gang. \\nDunno how we manage it with all the Africans and Indians and Asians living in our suburb too...\\n', u'\\nGoodness me. Everyone is in a hissy fit because Trump is implementing what he said he\\'d do, if elected. He\\'s elected now, yet the media is still generating biased accounts of what\\'s happening. No wonder Trump voters think the MSM is fake news.The six countries that Trump had put a temporary ban on citizens arriving from, are all countries that Obama has been bombing, droning, et al. That\\'s not really surprising, even if the US was keen to take in German Citizens during and after WW2.In terms of migration policy, Morrison is correct that the US is catching up to Australia\\'s xenophobic and racist policies, but why Australian are protesting Trump and not the domestic situation shows the true culture of most Strayans. Hypocrites to the core, projecting their denial onto \"the other\".So the media\\'s pic for POTUS didn\\'t get up, which may have saved us from WW3, but that\\'s not the way our beloved fourth estate conveys the message.\\n', u'\\nAnother failed comment from another failed leader.\\nRun again for office or be quiet KK.

How did the liberal party end up with such conservative, right-wing, brown-shirted dopes like Howard, Abbott and now Turnbull? Answer: By first catalysing fear and then making the most of it just to gain power. Apart from the Howard gun reforms and support of Australians serving overseas in theatres of heck while in an atmosphere of never ending deconstruction of Australian social fabric I can't think of one worthwhile thing that the Government of these three has actually done.\\n\", u\"\\nI seriously don't think Turnbull knows what he is anymore as it is clear he is not even in charge of himself.

I cannot recall another time in my lengthening years when the prevailing order has depended almost entirely for its survival on a single man who is determined to upend it. Trump is that man. He is hostile to the liberal democratic order that has prevailed since the end of WW2. It was until now the imperfect vehicle by which humanity has taken slow, occasionally faltering steps towards the primacy of human rights, greater wealth and prosperity for more people than at any other time in history, the freer movement of people across national boundaries and greater reliance on global institutions like the UN and on cooperative arrangements such as the EU and NATO as means of avoiding armed conflict. We are now returning to a world in which narrow national interests will again prevail, nations will assert raw power as they seek to carve out spheres of influence and the usual restraints on their conduct are being swept away.\\n', u'\\nSo you think we should emulate the immigration policies of Malaysia do you?\\n', u\"\\nThe Queens advisers made two very big mistakes there didn't they ??

Bert\\n', u\"\\nI'm sad and disappointed in Malcolm Turnbull.\\nI'm not a liberal voter, but he always looked like the candidate with the shrewdness, the intelligence, and the right mindset (for a conservative, of course) to do something worthwhile for this country. He was the man who bitch-slapped the Thatcher government during the Spycatcher trial in the 1980s. He was the leader of the pro-republican movement leading up to the referendum in 2000. He supported renewable energy.\\nHe stuffed up many times, especially over Utegate, but I thought, well, maybe he's learned from experience, and he'll do better next time.\\nSadly, since he became Prime Minister, instead of getting things done, he has started to disappear, bit by bit, so that today he is so thin and transparent as to be almost invisible.\\nI am truly disappointed that someone with so much promise has so spectacularly failed to deliver on anything. No leadership on refugees, no leadership on the Centrelink fiasco, no control over the nutters in his own party, and no leadership for the rest of this nation.\\nIn a world that has changed so much since the US election in November, and which has become even more uncertain in the past 10 days, we need a leader who will stand up and tell us what he believes in, and what he, and what this country, stands for.\\nWhere are you, Malcolm?\\n\", u'\\n\"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\"Grow up.\\n', u'\\nYes, yes I am.\\n', u\"\\nSurely the US attorney general has a very different role to that of Turnbull.

A value is only a value if the value of that value is very valuable to me. It may take a little bit of time to parse that. Just calling something a 'value' is meaningless. For example, there is the value of speaking the truth. However for that to genuinely be a value rather than a platitude, one must understand what the value of that value is; in this case the value of telling the truth is 'peace of mind'. However if peace of mind is not very valuable to you then there is no value in speaking the truth and consequently speaking the truth is not a value (for that person).\\n\", u\"\\nShe didn't mention Labor once.

What deals are being done and who's benefiting from them. This might be one heck of a smoke and mirrors event hiding something even more sinister... I hope someone is keeping eye's on what's going down behind closed doors.

Just because Turnbull isn't a lot of peoples cup of tea, doesn't mean they want the Labor party.\\n\", u'\\nHe\\'s mirroring Menzies WW2 conservative government.He followed Britain unquestionably, unwittingly, while they misused our Army in one military blunder after another and left us completely exposed while he sent more and more forces to help our \\'great friend\\'.Ultimately, Labor\\'s Curtin had to save the day, after years of having their \"Australia first\\' policies rejected by conservative governments who thought being a loyal and true ally was all we would ever need to be in this world.\\n', u'\\nYour sentiment is commendable Kristina. However in order to stand up for \"our values\" Malcolm would have to share them. While I\\'m sure Malcolm values the zeroes at the end of his Cayman Island bank accounts, and while I\\'m sure that he values his status as Prime Minister, I\\'m not sure that he actually has anything resembling the \"values\" of most decent Australians. There\\'s no profit in those \"values\". There\\'s no status in those \"values\". \"Values\" are about as much use to Malcolm and his Coalition cohorts as other lefty nonsense like integrity, ethics and morality.\\n', u\"\\nI initially read this thinking 'here we go, another attempt to wreck finally resolving offshore detention just for party-politics', but Kristina makes a fair point concerning eventual residency in the US as a pull factor. \\nAt the end of the day we need a system of transferring arrivals to a recognised, UN-administered refugee camp for processing. We need to pay our share to make this happen and we need to continue to take our share of people identified as genuine refugees as a result.\\n\", u'\\nTurnbull is such a disappointment promised so much....and gave nothing.

Yet our PM and his One Nation cabinet members are either too weak to voice concerns, or, and I suspect this it the real reason, they agree with his decision and wish they had thought of hiding a ban on Muslims under the cloak of a temporary ban on all citizens from 'dangerous' areas. \\nHang your head in shame Malcolm and all you other pricks who unashamedly supported Trumps views.

But, there are many millions of \"ordinary\" citizens who barrack for them; who vote for them. The deplorables, as Hilary labelled them. Many will be your colleagues, acquaintances, even family.

We can expect the usual toadying from our mal- administration because trump embodies their core values and (more) moderate mal with his enslavement to the rwnjs and his single seat majority wants to cling to power at all costs.\\nI fear dark days looming ahead and our idiots will march us up the creek following the US into more disastrous conflicts and will undoubtedly paint a larger target on Oz by following the yanks.\\n', u'\\nTurnbull ditched his formerly espoused views on climate change, the NBN, refugees etc in order to pander to the right of own party to get the job he is now incapable of performing. Hoisted on his own petard. Now we wonder why he doesn\\'t speak out about Right wing madness in the US, a country Australia has always unthinkingly followed and emulated? He\\'d have to discover the definition of \" principle\" in the dictionary first.\\n', u\"\\n\\nThe job of a leader is to understand people\\u2019s fears and to respond with assurance and conviction.\\n\\nThe only person's fear he understands is his own; his fear of losing the job he coveted for so long and sought, Gollum like, for all those years.

He does not represent Australian beliefs s , a moral vacuum .\\n', u'\\nPlenty. They are like common mynas, introduced, and pestilent.\\n', u'\\nWell said\\n', u'\\nIf Turnbull was a man of principle, he would call an early election now. If he were a leader, he would do this to allow the people of this country to decide, as they should be allowed to do in a democracy. If he were an honest man, he would realise and acknowledge the failure of the LNP government to govern for all Australians, and if he really cared for the people of this country he would listen when they protest the destruction of our society by those in his own government that seek to destroy the vulnerable, harm the environment and sell us out for their own financial benefit. \\nAs Turnbull has done none of these things, the only logical conclusion is that he has no principles, no courage, no honesty, and that the LNP fascist regime of secrecy, rorting, lying and destruction, is exactly what he wanted, and wants for this country. He will not call an early election and allow the people to decide, he will hang on until the bitter end, ensuring the LNP liars, thieves and fascists, can get all they can while the gettings good. Turnbull holds the people of this country in contempt every minute he continues to collude with the worst fascists in his cabinet, and the worst of the worst fascists around the world.\\n', u\"\\nNewspoll hasn't produced a report since Dec. 6.

Nearly 40 people, coming from more than 6 different towns, packed into a small living room and spent two and half hours strategizing how to coordinate with the other groups that are popping up all over Cleveland, and the US. We all agreed that we were not going to make the mistake of 2003 when the peace protests retreated instead of advancing. We have a two-prong attack: 1)immediate resistance to events like the ban on Muslims and 2) taking back the house and senate. \\nThis is happening everywhere. I urge our compatriots in other countries to do the same. We cannot allow the hate and fear agenda to become our story. I say \"compatriots\" because I\\'ve always lived by Virginia Woolf\\'s credo, \"My country is the whole world. \" Our first allegiance should be to our fellow humans, not where they hail from. \\nAnd with nukes on the table and a madman at the helm in my country, this is not one anyone can afford to sit out.

Well...he said he\\'d \"nuke anyone I feel like nuking\" and confoundingly went on to include Chicago and London in his potential hit list. I wrote the hour he said that and asked how anyone with a functioning brain could possibly consider voting for such an insane ninny. Here we are...now we have to extricate ourselves from this mess. No one is there to save us, except ourselves, in our millions. \\nAnyone in Europe who thinks they\\'re safe hasn\\'t been paying attention because here are the craven dolt\\'s nattering about nukes this summer; you know, when he still could have been stopped by ethical people:\\n\\nBOLLING: Donald, I understand they are not taking the cards off the table for ISIS or Islamic terror.

Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we\\u2019re doing. It\\u2019s in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that\\u2019s a bad thing not a good thing. The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That\\u2019s the way I feel. I think it is a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible. But I don\\u2019t want to take anything off the table. We have to negotiate. There will be times maybe when we\\u2019re going to be in a very deep, very difficult, very horrible negotiation.

In fact has done so little since he became PM that finding one piece of legislation that actually resembles its original state, that hasn't been watered down, and weakened to the point that it is unrecognisable and barely worth the paper it is written on is well nigh impossible.Turnbull is hamstrung, not by his colleagues, but by his own inadequacies... he is not a leader.. he cannot and will not stand up for his own supposed principles, he is a weak and ineffectual man who relies on hyperbole and overblown wordy rhetoric that is in reality no more than a whole pile of noise signifying nothing at all.He is reduced to attaching himself to the leg of Trump in the same manner as Howard grovelled to Bush Jnr.He does not speak for most Australians.\\n\", u'\\nYes.\\n', u\"\\nThe supposed reason these refugees weren't allowed into Australia was to discourage the people smugglers 'business model'.

But this time there are other great powers in the world, both economic and political, and a world economy driven independently of the US is feasible.

Previously Malcolm has been cowering in the corner in order to maintain his job and his ego's view of himself as a suave and urbane statesman. Of course the two can't live in the same space as we've seen and this has lead to a further shrinking to the point where Michelle Grattan asked him a question yesterday and he was completely blank - he didn't even know what she had said and had to gather himself to ask her to repeat her question. Even then he was lost at sea. It's only a small moment in the scheme of things but illuminating as to the degradation and confused state Turnbull is currently inhabiting.\\nThese are moments when one can either break down or break through. If there is something of substance left - if there ever was something other than a spoilt brat lurking beneath the wealth and privilege it will be more than interesting to see if it can revive.\\n\", u'\\nI wondered how he slept at night. Indeed, how do most of the LNP government members sleep at night?\\nBut clearly these incompetent, delusional nit wits care only about their own comfort zone.

American values = a bible, Jesus, the NRA and a gun for every in every man woman and child in every household.

Everybody knows that the best way to stop a child, or animal, from acting badly is to ignore the behaviour and do something else, which Turnbull has done.\\n', u'\\nOn a more serious note, Turnball is right to factor in the downsides to condemning Trump. He is the prime minister after all so knocking together a few pros and cons is not a bad idea. You can\\'t go make decisions off the hook like (oh wait).\\nAnyway:\\nPros:\\n1. we stand up for our values - yeah!2. we get on the \"right side of history\" - it depends on who the winner is3. we get to distract from our own mis-deeds - yeah!4. we cosy up to China whose our biggest trade partner - yeah?5. there\\'s safety in numbers (since everyone else is doing it).6. oh something to do with Australian dual-citizens;7. I also think there\\'s some other humans involved.\\nCons;1. America is still the biggest economy in the world;2. America still has the biggest military in the world;3. 1 and 2 means that America will either go out in a nuclear blaze of glory or still be the biggest economy and have the biggest military in 4 years time (or whenever he\\'s impeached);4. It might draw attention to our, you know, failings;5. Do we really want to be taking sides in the US v China bust up?\\nActually if you think about the pros and cons further, most of the money in America is on the coasts and most people (including corporations) on the coasts supported Clinton and are appalled by Trump.

Australian leaders have always turned a blind eye to human rights abuses in Indonesia, China and the US. No Australian leader in recent memory had the backbone to stand for what is right. Whilst doctors, educators and neighbours are encourage to dob domestic violence and abuse, political leaders are too scared to take the same approach and condemn unacceptable behaviour by the leaders of some countries. Why want to sit at the UN Security Council if Australia remains silent on the wrong doings of tyrants.\\n\", u'\\nDoes Donald now hold the title of the worlds most hated person.\\n', u'\\nTotally with you on this.

The best case I see is a recession caused by China trade war.

I hear he has now fired the acting AG, so much for Democracy and freedom of speach.\\nWhile we as a people cant change immediate U.S policy a product boycott by citizens of the world will send a strong message that cant be ignored.\\n', u\"\\nNobody's puppet attacking the puppet people ! Obviously Turnbull prefers to sleepwalk his way into the next election but the chances are that the polling will be the end for him as it was for Gillard and Rudd and Abbott. He won't be leading the Liberals at the next election and it seems that he doesn't care anyway.

If the rest of the world can be pleased at the same time, great, but if it can't the population that elected that leader comes first. \\nOpen borders are no picnic. The fact that you don't hear contantly about the misdeeds (Germany, Scandinavia) means that the press tries to play it down. Anybody who has a second language and can access the news that have not been translated into English knows that. \\nThere is only one argument to take in people from these countries: The US messed up these countries and now has to mop them up. You break it, you own it, from Afghanistan to Syria. But in practical terms, the US cannot take in all these millions, so we are back where we started. Even with the help of those who tagged along to destroy the ME, Britain and Australia, the camps cannot be emptied.\\n\", u'\\nYes any country is entitled to define criteria for entry. Obviously criteria must be easily assessed so being a racist would pose problems because it would be difficult to determine.\\n', u\"\\nI'll take that as a yes.\\n\", u\"\\nI'm fully aware of what this mob have done and continue to do. But Labor are not yet in a position to set things right. I dont see two wings, same bird , not at all. Any perception of Labor toeing the same line is a false one.

When I heard Turnbull saying he wouldn\\'t criticise the Dump\\'s policy, I thought, \"You weasel. You watery fool.\" \\nLook at Canada, proudly offering refuge to people in need.

Be a captain and go down with the ship.\\n\", u'\\nand the end result usually looks like a piece of shit\\n', u'\\nAt this time of crisis the country needs leadership desperately. But Malcolm Turnbull is now in a death spiral of dysfunction.\\nIt is quite understandable that Malcolm Turnbull has declined to criticize Donald Trump\\'s unique brand of dog whistle politics - or bullhorn politics, if you prefer - since, whether in Australia or America, that low form of political manipulation seeks to distract the populace from the negative outcomes of their regressive economic policies: conditions may well get even worse, and there could be another world economic crisis, or even a world war, that could take decades to recover from. It is also true that Turnbull is afraid of scotching the refugee transfer deal with the US, so Turnbull has to kow tow.\\nThe world watches in shock as America enters a very dark period, and the PM has shown his abject weakness by failing to join May and Trudeau in calling the Trump policy unacceptable. \\nAustralia has a panoply of retrograde, race baiting politicians like Tony Abbott, George Christensen, Cory Bernardi, and Pauline Hanson, trying to wedge Malcolm Turnbull by spruiking Donald Trump and calling for reduced immigration intakes, and bans on immigration to Australia.\\nThis political environment exposes the hopelessness and hypocrisy in the government based on the divide between the \"moderates\" and the \"conservatives\", although as time goes on Turnbull is crab scuttling to the right to protect his tenuous hold on power, even as Abbott continues to white ant Turnbull out of revenge.\\nSince the cause of the problems here and abroad is not immigration, as the practitioners of dog whistle politics would have people believe, but economic malaise, and the widespread social disruption it causes, conditioned by neoliberalism \\u201cstrong borders\\u201d, terrorism scare campaigns, and demagoguery can never solve it. These political manipulations are just misdirection.\\nTo genuinely respond to the economic and political crises that are causing so much fear and uncertainty the government would have to embark on a program of progressive economic reform that would stop rise of economic inequality, the fall of real wages, and the erosion of the middle class.\\nBut the Turnbull government, like the Abbott regime before it, is ideologically committed to the unfair and failed ideology of neoliberalism. So they are in a way forced to use scare tactics. By using racism, xenophobia and fear of the other right wing neoliberal politicians can persuade average people to vote against their own best economic interests by distracting them from their true agenda: to redistribute wealth upwards, cut welfare, and reach the other goals of neoliberal policy, like privatization - of the public health and school systems - and cutting taxes for the wealthy.\\nThis has been the ultimate goal for successive Coalition governments: to turn Australia into a neoliberal plutocracy by using deceptive demagoguery to politically manipulate the electorate.\\nThe world must now reject the system as it is currently constituted so that healthy economic, social, and environmental policy can be established. The government is ill-prepared to face these necessities, and Malcolm Turnbull continues to fail the country by looking after his own narrow interests, those of the Liberal Party, and the already well-off and the business community at the expense of the greater interests of the nation and the people of Australia.\\n', u\"\\nGood ol' lickspittle Australia.\\nMalcolm Turnbull's National Press Club speech tomorrow will be fiercely scrutinised by the fourth estate.\\n\", u'\\nAlternative fact: Malcolm Turnbull is a leader.\\n', u\"\\nMany are still waiting for 'The Real Malcolm' to stand up.\\nUnfortunately he has already has, and there's nothing there. \\nExcept a long term plan to give tax cuts to big business at the expense of ordinary Australians.Everything else he once said he stood for has been sacrificed along the way.\\n\", u\"\\n\\nThe job of a leader ...\\n\\n... is to lead.\\nNo chance then.\\nStrongly reminds me of the 'rise' of Hanson Mk1.\\nWay back then (less than 20 years) people from across the political spectrum, in the community, the churches were pleading with Howard to call out her racist xenophobic ignorance ... but nothing ... until he finally saw the redneck vote slipping away ... and then ... he copied her\\nThis time round the Turnbull's RWNJs are aping Trump from the get go.\\n\", u'\\nWhat he means is that the right has moved further to the right.\\n', u'\\nYes buddy, but the US is meant to be an alliance of shared values\\n', u'\\nVery good.\\n', u'\\nSo when the facts are the enemy, go for deflections hey !\\n1/10 for that one.\\n', u\"\\nI believe Chump's recklessness is an Australian issue and a world issue.\\n\", u'\\nI am sick and tired of this nonsense that the left have stifled debate.

The person we need to lead us is someone with a moral core, an adherence to humane values and a spine..\\n', u'\\nUsing the word lead and Turnbull in the same sentence is ridiculous.\\n', u'\\nMalcolm should be calling out those countries that have permanent travel bans actually based on religion.\\nGuess which ones they are?\\n', u\"\\nTurnbull has shown us before that he isn't a leader, but a follower.\\n\", u\"\\nSays it all and whatever the rabid Right say, this is something we've never thought possible in the USA.\\nThis is about our values and we're stuck with a Neville Chamberlain.\\n\", u'\\nI think the WEEK AS PISS approach by malcolm turnbull to the Trump cluster fuck will have an accelerating effect on his down fall....\\nTurnbull looked like a defeated man yesterday in his press conference and did anyone notice the EAT SHIT GRIN has gone??\\n', u\"\\nSome of us haven't forgotten UTEGATE, not by a long shot.\\n\", u'\\nNo the Press.\\n', u'\\nHis track record should have been warning enough and should have reminded voters of that old one about leopards and spots!\\n', u\"\\nHe'd have done a great job in 1936 telling us how fantastic the Olympics were in Berlin!\\n\", u'\\nThe question is, how can a man with no values stand up for our values?\\n', u\"\\nSave your breathe and words, Kristina.....\\nMal will be gone soon...... give it a few more months.... it's Fizzed already.\\n\", u\"\\nSomeone reminded me again last night of a Keating saying and it applies very much so to Turnbull. He is a shiver looking for a spine and it's so true. He is shivering in his boots at the thought of offending his FRWNJ colleagues that he is willing to sacrifice REAL Australian values for his own benefit. Shame on you, you piece of slime, Turdball.\\n\"]\n",

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/malcolm-turnbull\">Malcolm Turnbull</a> is now living on his knees. He is a man afraid \\u2013 fearful of his backbench, fearful of the polls, fearful of losing his so-called \\u201crefugee deal\\u201d with the United States.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Australia has no need for a fearful prime minister. Right now, we desperately need a conviction leader.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The world stands at a dangerous crossroads. <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/29/mikhail-gorbachev-is-worried-about-a-world-war-he-hopes-trump-and-putin-can-stop-it/?utm_term=.12447ef17109\">Mikhail Gorbachev is warning of global war</a>. A despotic and dangerous toddler named Donald Trump occupies the White House. Trump\\u2019s refugee and immigration bans have created global chaos and protest, and handed Islamic State its best-ever recruiting tool. If Trump continues as he has begun \\u2013 by simply implementing the promises he made during the campaign \\u2013 watch the global economy completely upend because of tariffs on Mexico and China. Meanwhile, Trump and Russia\\u2019s President Vladimir Putin are both talking up the need to increase their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.</p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>This is not the time for the Australian government to offer mealy-mouthed platitudes about not commenting on the policies of other countries. Anyway, such platitudes are ridiculous. Just two weeks ago the Turnbull government <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-16/japanese-whaling-criticised-by-government-sea-shepherd-footage/8184640?pfmredir=sm\">criticised the government of Japan</a> for whaling in Antarctica. Last September Turnbull <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/beijing-dodges-south-china-sea-bases-rebuke/news-story/db3ce86eae6700692cdbe03f35e84487\">urged China</a> to respect the ruling of an arbitration tribunal in The Hague regarding the South China Sea. Turnbull also <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.skynews.com.au/news/politics/federal/2016/09/30/turnbull-doesn-t-doubt-russian-mh17-culpability.html\">criticised Russia</a> for blocking the UN security council from taking criminal proceedings over the downing of MH17 and promised to continue to pressure Russia.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p> Trump\\u2019s policies on refugees, immigration, trade, foreign aid and defence all impact directly \\u2013 and in most cases, negatively \\u2013 on Australia. Some go against international conventions, and certainly violate the basic tenets of western democracy. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>It\\u2019s a time to state what we as Australians believe and make clear for which values and principles we stand \\u2013 and which ones we condemn.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Australians are feeling nervous, jumpy and scared. I am overwhelmed by the people who stop me in the gym, the shops, or at my kids\\u2019 weekend sports matches to talk about Trump \\u2013 how he got there, what might happen, and what it means for us. I am also struck by how many say they are afraid. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>The job of a leader includes understanding people\\u2019s fears, acknowledging and interpreting those concerns, and then responding to them in an assuring manner, with clarity of conviction, purpose and values.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>That\\u2019s not what Australians are getting from Turnbull. Instead, we see the fear in his eyes. Turnbull isn\\u2019t reassuring his constituents: he\\u2019s reflecting their fear like a mirror.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>It is no longer \\u201cthe best time to be alive\\u201d. It would be foolish for Turnbull to repeat that mantra ad nauseam. Instead he must acknowledge that the world has changed in the past few months, and he must explain how he is going to lead Australia through these changes.</p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Some will argue that Turnbull needed to avoid megaphone diplomacy \\u2013 that is, direct public criticism of Trump\\u2019s refugee bans \\u2013 to preserve the US deal to take refugees off Nauru and Manus Island. Two points: one, Trump\\u2019s assurances that the deal will be honoured are <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/31/us-could-resettle-zero-refugees-from-manus-and-nauru-and-still-honour-deal\">meaningless</a>. The US can still honour the commitment and not take a single person from these offshore facilities. This puts Australia in the worst possible position: selling our silence and getting nothing in return. </p>', u'\\n', u'\\n', u'<p>Two, there is a solution to Turnbull\\u2019s Nauru and Manus Island problem that doesn\\u2019t depend on the whims of an idiotic and unpredictable US president: bring the refugees to Australia. If the boats have stopped because of turnbacks and other efforts, why does Australia need to keep detaining refugees in offshore detention facilities? Don\\u2019t say it\\u2019s \\u201cpull factors\\u201d. There is no difference between sending Nauruan and Manus refugees in a \\u201cone-off deal\\u201d to the US, or bringing them in a \\u201cone-off\\u201d deal to Australia. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Some will say Turnbull is hemmed in by One Nation and elements of his rightwing backbench. If he speaks out against Trump, or otherwise stands for his convictions, he will face moves against him at home. He might lose his job. If that is true, it is more reason Turnbull needs to stand for his core beliefs. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Acting out of fear isn\\u2019t leading, it is following. Stay silent, Malcolm, and George Christensen, Cory Bernardi and Pauline Hanson will be running the country. </p>', u'\\n', u'<p>Stand up, Malcolm Turnbull. Australia needs you to lead. </p>', u'\\n', u'<div class=\"submeta\">\\n\\n<div class=\"submeta__section-labels\">\\n<ul class=\"submeta__links\">\\n<li class=\"submeta__link-item\">\\n<a
