That\\u2019s a major war crime. People were hanged for it at Nuremberg. But put that aside.

       "  u'\\n\"What is important to me is that others reading these blogs should not be led to believe that opinions that are not based on any factual underpinnings are indeed, just that.\"\\nIsn\\'t that special. You\\'re only trying to protect the delicate sensibilities of the radical left who might be led astray by my comments. Because Chomsky is all they\\'ve got. Well, hell. Let\\'s just tell them the truth from a real authority and let them evaluate Chomsky for themselves, shall we?---------Benjamin Kerstein: There are a couple of main points that should be made. First, Chomsky is an absolutely shameless liar. A master of the argument in bad faith. He will say anything in order to get people to believe him. Even worse, he will say anything in order to shut people up who disagree with him. And I\\u2019m not necessarily talking about his public critics. If you\\'ve ever seen how he acts with ordinary students who question what he says, it\\'s quite horrifying. He simply abuses them in a manner I can only describe as sadistic. That is, he clearly enjoys doing it. I don\\'t think anyone ought to be allowed to get away with that kind of behavior.\\nSecond, Chomsky is immensely important to the radical left. When it comes to American foreign policy he isn\\'t just influential, he\\'s basically all they have. Almost any argument made about foreign affairs by the radical left can be traced back to him. That wasn\\'t the case when he started out back in the late \\'60s, but it is now.\\nThird, he is essentially the last totalitarian. Despite his claims otherwise, he\\'s more or less the last survivor of a group of intellectuals who thought systemic political violence and totalitarian control were essentially good things. He babbles about human rights all the time, but when you look at the regimes and groups he\\'s supported, it\\u2019s a very bloody list indeed.\\nCommunism and fascism are obviously dead as the proverbial doornail, but I doubt the totalitarian temptation will ever go away. The desire for unity and a kind of beautiful tyranny seems to spring from somewhere deep in the human psyche.\\nFourth\\u2014and this may be most important\\u2014he makes people stupid. In this sense, he\\'s more like a cult leader or a New Age guru than an intellectual. He allows people to be comfortable with their prejudices and their hatreds, and he undercuts their ability to think in a critical manner. To an extent, this has to do with his use of emotional and moral blackmail. Since he portrays everyone who disagrees with him as evil, if you do agree with him you must be on the side of good and right. This is essentially a kind of secular puritanism, and it\\'s very appealing to many people, for obvious reasons, I think. We all want to think well of ourselves, whether we deserve it or not.\\nThere is an intellectual side to this, as well. You see it clearly in his famous debate with Michel Foucault. Chomsky says at one point that there is a moral and ethical order that is hardwired into human beings. And Foucault basically asks him, why? How do you know this hardwired morality exists? And even if it exists, how can we know that it is, in fact, moral in the first place? We may feel it to be moral, but that doesn\\'t make it true.\\nChomsky\\'s answer is essentially: Because I believe it to be so. Now, whatever that is, it isn\\'t thinking. In fact, it\\'s an excuse for not thinking. Ironically, Chomsky later said that Foucault was the most amoral man he ever met, whereas I would argue that Foucault was simply pointing out that Chomsky\\'s \\u201cmorality\\u201d is in fact a form of nihilism.\\nI think people come to Chomsky and essentially worship him for precisely that reason. He allows them to feel justified in their refusal to think. They never have to ask themselves any difficult questions or provide any difficult answers. It\\u2019s a form of intellectual cowardice essentially, but I\\'m sure you can see its appeal.\\nThis may be one of the reasons for Chomsky\\'s hostility to psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis may be many things, but it is certainly a method of gaining self-knowledge, of asking difficult questions about one\\'s self and others. And that is precisely what he, and his followers, want to avoid.\\nMy apologies for the length of this answer, but I think you\\'ll agree that, of all the bad things people are capable of, their refusal to think is one of the worst, mainly because it leads to most of the other bad things of which they are capable.\\nhttp://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/noam-chomsky-last-totalitarian\\n',\n",

They took the bait and fell right into the trap laid for them by the Americans. \\nIn a political system with any degree of accountability at all, Kim Il-sung would have been removed from power by late 1950 for having so badly miscalculated America's response to seeing South Korea overrun by the DPRK. If Kim Il-sung had truly believed the Americans were a bunch of liars who couldn't be trusted, he never would have accepted at face value (as he apparently did) Secretary of State Dean Acheson's claim in January 1950 that South Korea fell outside of America's defense perimeter.\\n\",\n",

According to this apologist from my alma mater, the North Koreans apparently never attacked the South; China apparently never intervened; and Gen. MacArthur was never fired for pushing to invade China! Also, the family dynasty that runs impoverished North Korea apparently never threatens to annihilate the USA! It\\'s a nursery school filled with innocents in the North according to this professor! Usually USA foreign policy is dogmatically linked to imperialism; but this professor is making a thinly veiled reference to Nazi-like \"extermination\" campaigns. Apparently the USA never helped Europe and the USSR defeat the Nazis, either! His point that the USA does not win land wars in the Far East? It\\'s a salient point but the historian might consult Dwight Eisenhower, who explained why more than 60 years ago.

Consider how China's economic might is rising and the US is in decline (it is no matter how much it's being denied by some).\\nFrom any way you look at it the US is going to eventually fail just like the Nazis did unless they start to realize that they aren't the only player in the game. A lot, I mean quite a lot of people would be more then happy seeing them taken down a peg or three. Some are actively trying to bring that about.

This is the reason why we have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the joint declaration of the powers. \\n\\nAs for your point about war crimes. You will recall that Karl Doenitz was charged and tried at Nuremberg for waging an unrestricted u-boat campaign against Allied shipping. While the Tribunal found evidence to support the charge, no penalty was imposed on him for that transgression owing to the British and American use of submarines in the same fashion ... \\n\\nIn view of all the facts proved and in particular of an order of the British Admiralty announced on the 8th May, 1940, according to which all vessels should be sunk at sight in the Skagerrak, and the answers to interrogatories by Admiral Nimitz stating that unrestricted submarine warfare was carried on in the Pacific Ocean by the United States from the first day that nation entered the war, the sentence of Doenitz is not assessed on the ground of his breaches of the international law of submarine warfare.\\n\\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-karl-doenitz\\nThat concept, that you shouldn't be penalized based on similar conduct by your accuser, is similar to the concept of unclean hands in civil law ...\\n... I think we can all be certain, given the gentleness that Japan displayed to the conquered in its Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere in the years preceding its defeat--that they would have displayed the same nuance while adjudicating suspected Allied war crimes (had, in the end, the positions been reversed).\\n\",\n",

       "  u'\\nSo many on here trying to re-write history and play down USA genocidal actions against North Korea, check this article from the Asia Pacific Journal \\nThe American Air War and the Destruction of North Korea\\nThe Korean War, a \\u201climited war\\u201d for the US and UN forces, was for Koreans a total war. The human and material resources of North and South Korea were used to their utmost. The physical destruction and loss of life on both sides was almost beyond comprehension, but the North suffered the greater damage, due to American saturation bombing and the scorched-earth policy of the retreating UN forces.1 The US Air Force estimated that North Korea\\u2019s destruction was proportionately greater than that of Japan in the Second World War, where the US had turned 64 major cities to rubble and used the atomic bomb to destroy two others. American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea -- that is, essentially on North Korea --including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II.2 The number of Korean dead, injured or missing by war\\u2019s end approached three million, ten percent of the overall population. The majority of those killed were in the North, which had half of the population of the South; although the DPRK does not have official figures, possibly twelve to fifteen percent of the population was killed in the war, a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II.3\\nThe act which inflicted the greatest loss of civilian life in the Korean War by far, one which the North Koreans have claimed ever since was America\\u2019s greatest war crime, was the aerial bombardment of North Korean population centers. American control of the skies over Korea was overwhelming. During the summer and fall, North Korean air defenses were virtually non-existent. Lightly armed, local self-defense units in occupied South Korea could only watch and suffer as their towns and villages were obliterated from the air.5 By the end of the war, North Korea claimed that only two modern buildings remained standing in Pyongyang.\\nFor the Americans, strategic bombing made perfect sense, giving advantage to American technological prowess against the enemy\\u2019s numerical superiority. The American command dismissed British concerns that mass bombardment would turn world opinion against them, insisting that air attacks were accurate and civilian casualties limited.6 Russian accusations of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets did not register with the Americans at all. But for the North Koreans, living in fear of B-29 attacks for nearly three years, including the possibility of atomic bombs, the American air war left a deep and lasting impression. The DPRK government never forgot the lesson of North Korea\\u2019s vulnerability to American air attack, and for half a century after the Armistice continued to strengthen anti-aircraft defenses, build underground installations, and eventually develop nuclear weapons to ensure that North Korea would not find itself in such a position again. The long-term psychological effect of the war on the whole of North Korean society cannot be overestimated. The war against the United States, more than any other single factor, gave North Koreans a collective sense of anxiety and fear of outside threats that would continue long after the war\\u2019s end.\\nNorth Korea\\u2019s considerable economic achievements since liberation were all but completely wiped out by the war. By 1949, after two years of a planned economy, North Korea had recovery from the post-liberation chaos, and economic output had reached the level of the colonial period.7 Plans for 1950 were to increase output again by a third in the North, and the DPRK leadership had expected further economic gains following integration with the agriculturally more productive South after unification. According to DPRK figures, the war destroyed some 8,700 factories, 5,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and 600,000 homes.8 Every significant town, city and industrial area in North Korea had already been bombed. In the spring of 1953, the Air Force targeted irrigation dams on the Yalu River, both to destroy the North Korean rice crop and to pressure the Chinese, who would have to supply more food aid to the North. Five reservoirs were hit, flooding thousands of acres of farmland, inundating whole towns and laying waste to the essential food source for millions of North Koreans.10 Only emergency assistance from China, the USSR, and other socialist countries prevented widespread famine.\\nhttp://apjjf.org/-Charles-K.-Armstrong/3460/article.html\\n',\n",

Or did it deserve its independence and freedom?They (ie USSR and USA, the only ones who mattered in the region) both declared themselves in favour of a free independent Korea. But first they had to get the Japanese out. Hence the agreement that Soviet and US armies would temporarily occupy Korea along the 38th parallel pending the development of an independent state.The trouble was, with the Cold War starting, both sides planned from the start that the \"independent\" state would be under their control.There was brutal violence exercised by both sides against opponents and some pretty large-scale fighting before 1950, as you say.However, there is no doubt, as has been confirmed by the opening up of the Soviet archives, that the Korean War was an act of aggression by North Korea designed to conquer South Korea and forcibly turn it into part of the Communist Empire.\\n',\n",

That process is denied or slowed against irregular forces but, in turn, likely prevents their coalescence into war winning overwhelming force.\\nI would argue against a lost war in Korea; more a draw. \\nDifferences between then and now are perhaps founded in aerospace power: risk to US territory which, if attacked, would threaten accurate response against leaderships, as well as key infrastructure and facilities.\\nChina is more rational, as well as now fully nuclear capable.

       "  u\"\\nVery poor. For a good, balanced history, warts and all try 'The Korean War' by Max Hastings ( 1987 I think ) can't recall the publisher.\\nThe quandary with the current Korean crisis is that, just like 1950, any attempt to remove the Kim regime will be resisted by China, who have of course a land border and a few million troops to boot . \\nAmerica / Trump haven't the stomach to take casualties in the way that China / NK can. Just a few captured pilots will create enough stink to stop an air campaign and the US public will not tolerate / risk casualties that could be very high indeed .\\nChina on the other hand does not want the NK millions as refugees ( in the main ill educated peasants ) few of whom who speak Chinese and who are hopelessly indoctrinated. It really wants the status quo to remain pretty much as it is.\\nAbout the only sensible option is for China to apply hard pressure on NK to de-nuclearise with similar guarantees from the USA to withdraw THAAD and nukes and for Japan to guarantee not to develop weapons. Then NK has to reduce its armed forces ( to feed its people ) . The USA will have to remove troops from ROK proportionately ( which will be popular / cost effective for the USA. Finally the USA/Russia/China have to have a treaty to keep the whole area essentially de militarised \\nWill this happen? Well it had better, for if NK is stupid enough to lob 4 missiles over Japan towards Guam, Trump HAS to fight. I don't think the Chinese / USA/ or NK for that matter , are that mad.\\n\",\n",

In fact, he\\'s cited in the essay you link by Shen Zhihua (page 8 of the pdf).\\nThe essay you link, whilst fascinating, also does nothing to counter what Cumings writes above. What it does do is flesh out the Sino-Russian context.\\nIf anyone/thing could be said to have started the Korean war it was the Russian-US split and control of the country. Each country allowing or setting up governments in their respective halves sympathetic to their ideology. Both halves faced mass insurrections and seemingly ignoring the one popular Korean wish at the time for unification. The south was actually occupied by the Americans and had a US military government in the early years. It\\'s not hard to see then the motives for the North to want to remove the occupying power in the South (the memory of Japanese occupation all too fresh) and, favouring it\\'s own brand of governance to that which had been selected for the South.\\nZhihua\\'s essay rather gives the impression that had the North acted sooner, there may have been more popular support, and less resistence, in the South - this in itself is quite interesting.\\nBut the powers behind the split country and their actions that ultimately lead to the war cannot be ignored as the tinder box that fomented, initiated and condoned the conflict.\\nThe Russians were tricksy and the Chinese self serving. The idea that the US were somehow bumbling into the affair with best intentions is completely and utterly laughable though. They were no less self serving and tricksy regarding their occupation of the South.\\nBroad dismissals such as your Castalian, particularly when they contain nonsense McCarthyist language like \"Sympathizer\", are wholly anti intellectual, dishonest and ultimately, dangerous.\\n',\n",

Even Vietnam is being deleted from the national consciousness as will Iraq and Afghanistan. It does not do for the corporate state to let the peasants dwell on failure and lost war in the name of profits.

The CIA operative Howard Hunt was only too happy to describe the \"terror campaign\" in Guatemala. The American bubble produced Trump. It not only blinds them to overseas wars in the name of profit but to their own history. In the bubble the west was cowboys and free-enterprise not a big government army exterminating millions to take their land for the settlers. The civil war was a war between valiant brothers rather than the truth - one side was valiant and the other capitalist racist slave traders who would betray and destroy the republic before giving up their crime and lies.Trump has loosed the right wing extremists of the bubble and they have killed a few recently including the young woman in Charlottesville. Blowing up Korea again produces profit and brings the China War one step closer. All aims of the corporate state. Those in the bubble will see what they are told to.

That struggle became an armed one from 1932 onwards.\\nThe US vanquished the Japanese in 1945 and the country was ceded to the USA as part of the surrender terms. Dean Rusk then drew a line at the 38th parallel, artificially dividing the country. This was done due to increasing Russian influence in the northern part of the country and to delineate where communism ended and capitalism commenced. So, despite the Japanese defeat, all Kim Il-sung could do was to start fighting another invader - the USA.\\nFrom 1948-1950, there were open hostilities along the DMZ and both sides made incursions into the other's territory. In the south, the US-backed president, Syngman Rhee, conducted a brutal purge of communists, sympathisers, their families and friends. No-one knows for sure how many were killed or how many simply disappeared, but the numbers are estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.

Finally knowing that finally he achieved the goal of nuclear tipped ICBM's and sitting on that knowledge unless or until he needed it? Or announcing for all the world to hear that not only has he now got them but decides to issue threats against the US that he will take out various cities with them starting with Guam? For what reason, because he doesn't like that the US holds naval exercises with Japan and South Korea precisely because NK still has ambitions for invading SK again, to remind NK who took out a naval vessel of SK for no valid reason which posed no threat he just felt like doing it? Remember too that he locked up a naive American citizen for stealing a propaganda banner with a sentence totally not befitting the crime, until they either torture him too far or regardless only hand him back in a physical state close to death who dies after one week. Kim Jung Un started this whole damn mess, he's the one who needs to stand down and who has bought himself a whole heap of trouble he could have avoided had he only kept his mouth shut, must be in need of more money or has to show off for the wife, who the hell knows.\\n\",\n",

In the Russian Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviet Union established a communist government led by Kim Il-sung. The Soviet Union withdrew as agreed from Korea in 1948, and U.S. troops withdrew in 1949.\\nWith the end of the war with Japan, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Communists and Nationalists. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with mat\\xe9riel and manpower.\\nThe North Korean contributions to the Chinese Communist victory were not forgotten after the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea.\\nChina promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea. The Chinese support created a deep division between the Korean Communists, and Kim Il-sung\\u2019s authority within the Communist party was challenged by the Chinese faction led by Pak Il-yu, who was later purged by Kim.\\nBy 1949, South Korean forces had reduced the active number of communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000.\\nKim began seeking Stalin\\u2019s support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to attempt to persuade him.\\nIn April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States.\\nKim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned the U.S. would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.\\nThroughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea.\\nBy mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.\\nIn contrast, the ROK Army defenders were unprepared and ill-equipped. As of 25 June 1950 the ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-piece air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT6 advanced-trainer airplanes.\\nI'd also like to know why everyone seems to think that it's ok that KJU doesn't just announce that he finally has nukes capable of reaching the US but proceeds to threaten the US repeatedly until DT has to respond.

       "  u\"\\nThe misrepresented litany of sin and admonishment towards the United States serves only to warp the public\\u2019s perceptions of levels of culpability for the deaths that resulted from the Korean War. This is dangerous as it obfuscates the very real dangers presented by North Korea whilst simultaneously eroding any public support for action by the US and its allies. \\nLet me be clear that I am adamantly opposed to the orange clown who currently resides in the White House. The man has neither the knowledge nor the intellect to manage this very complex situation from which there could be world-changing ramifications. However, the suggestion to blithely write off the North\\u2019s threats as \\u201clots of bluster and bombast\\u201d shows either dishonesty or gross historical ignorance. For example the author references the US spy ship Pueblo incident from January 23rd 1968, purposely ignoring the \\u201cBlue House Raid\\u201d of the 21st January 1968 where a unit of commandoes from North Korea infiltrated the South and attempted to assassinate the President. Mr Cumings then also fails to refer to the attempts by the US and UN to hold a conference on the 23rd to defuse the situation but the North had the conference postponed by a day so that they could conduct a co-ordinated assault on the Pueblo and capture of 82 men who were then tortured and used as bargaining chips. \\nIt is neither useful nor \\u201cedgy\\u201d to heap vitriol on the US in what has become an increasingly publicised trope that puts forward the proposition that the US wants to reignite the Korean War. Contrary to Mr Cumings\\u2019 misleadingly partisan article above the US and South Korea have been given plenty of opportunities to resume war by the continual aggression and incitement from the Kim dynasty \\u2013 to date they have consciously avoiding doing so. The possession of nuclear ICBMs by the North presents a serious risk as they have continually demonstrated that they are willing to attack both South Korean and US personnel (see the shelling of Yeonpyeong and this list https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_border_incidents_involving_North_Korea). \\nThe article specifically avoids any reference to the monumental human rights violations of the \\u201cDemocratic\\u201d People's Republic of Korea despite the deaths of millions of its citizens and the estimated 120,000+ people that rot in the regime\\u2019s concentration camps. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-un-excerpts-idUSBREA1G0OF20140217\\nThis has been a lot for people to read so thank you to anyone who has taken the interest to get this far. I am genuinely concerned that the article is both dishonest and destructive as many people will not question the US being responsible for all the world\\u2019s ills. I realise people are busy but it is of paramount importance that we familiarise ourselves with the history of the conflict. In brief: The Korean War began because North Korea together with its Russian allies decided that they would not participate in a free election that was put forward under UN auspices in 1948 to allow the nation\\u2019s people independence, instead they decided to invade South Korea in 1950, less than a year after US forces had departed. This was done with the tacit support of China whom North Korea had supported in the conclusion of its own civil war against the Nationalists. \\nAt the time the US had actually decommissioned the majority of its military since the conclusion of the Second World War as the public did not want to continue paying the vast expenditures necessary for a massive fighting force. This meant that when China\\u2019s armies entered the war to support the North it became a bloody stalemate. Neither side had a decisive edge to bring about victory resulting in the deaths of many innocent civilians on both sides. War is not a game it is a tragedy, innocent people always die. The author\\u2019s clear argument is that the only just course would have been for the US to surrender the South to avoid bloodshed. It is a ridiculous argument; by the same token he, no doubt, would also argue that the Allies ought to have avoided conflict in WWII and surrendered to the Nazis.\\n\",\n",

       "  u'\\n\"Noam Chomsky provides a more dramatic description of the situation: \\u201cWhen US forces entered Korea in 1945, they dispersed the local popular government, consisting primarily of antifascists who resisted the Japanese, and inaugurated a brutal repression, using Japanese fascist police and Koreans who had collaborated with them during the Japanese occupation. About 100,000 people were murdered in South Korea prior to what we call the Korean War, including 30-40,000 killed during the suppression of a peasant revolt in one small region, Cheju Island.\\u201d\\nIn sharp contrast to its position on Japan and Germany, Washington wanted the (Western dominated) UN to take responsibility for Korea in 1947. The Soviets objected, claiming the international organization had no jurisdiction over post- WWII settlement issues (as the US had argued for Germany and Japan). Instead, Moscow proposed that all foreign forces withdraw from Korea by January 1948. Washington demurred, convincing member states to create the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to organize elections in the part of Korea occupied by the US. For its part, the Soviet bloc boycotted UNTCOK. Canada joined UNTCOK even though Prime Minister Mackenzie King noted privately \\u201cthe [US] State Department was simply using the United Nations as an arm of that office to further its own policies.\\u201d\\nThe UN sponsored election in South Korea led to the long-term division of that country and Canada\\u2019s involvement in a conflict that would cause untold suffering. On May 10, 1948 the southern part of Korea held UNTCOK sponsored elections. In the lead-up to the election leftwing parties were harassed in a campaign to \\u201cremove Communism\\u201d from the south. As a result leftwing parties refused to participate in elections \\u201cwrought with problems\\u201d that \\u201cprovoked an uprising on the island of Cheju, off Korea\\u2019s southern coast, which was brutally repressed.\\u201d\\nAfter the poll Canada was among the first countries to recognize the Republic of Korea in the south, effectively legitimizing the division of the country. External Affairs minister Lester Pearson sent Syngman Rhee, who became president, a note declaring \\u201cfull recognition by the Government of Canada of the Republic of Korea as an independent sovereign State with jurisdiction over that part of the Korean peninsula in which free elections were held on May 10 1948, under the observation of the United Nations Temporary Commission.\\u201d Conversely, Ottawa refused to recognize the North, which held elections after the South, and opposed its participation in UNTCOK reports. For Pearson the South held \\u201cfree elections\\u201d while those in the North \\u201chad not been held in a democratic manner\\u201d since the Soviets did not allow UNTCOK to supervise them. After leaving office Pearson contradicted this position, admitting \\u201cRhee\\u2019s government was just as dictatorial as the one in the North, just as totalitarian. Indeed, it was more so in some ways.\\u201d\\nThe official story is that the Korean War began when the Soviet-backed North invaded the South on June 25, 1950. The US then came to the South\\u2019s aid. As is the case with most official US history the story is incomplete, if not downright false. Korea: Division, Reunification, and US foreign Policy notes: \\u201cThe best explanation of what happened on June 25 is that Syngman Rhee deliberately initiated the fighting and then successfully blamed the North. The North, eagerly waiting for provocation, took advantage of the southern attack and, without incitement by the Soviet Union, launched its own strike with the objective of capturing Seoul. Then a massive U.S. intervention followed.\\u201d (Global Research)\\n',\n",

Though the northern areas had been largely won back by indigenous partisan fighters backed by China and Russia the southern region had still been in control of the Imperial Japanese army until they surrendered to the US. The US then used Japanese troops to control the southern region until then could step in and install a puppet regime. The reason the southern region had no army is because they had not established a fighting force in combat with Imperial Japan and so when the Japanese surrendered there was a vacuum. The US tried to step in to that vacuum and impose a US solution, which was rejected by the Koreans and the US then had to launch a full scale invasion, strong-arming the UN to provide international legitimacy. It was similar in Vietnam where the Brits went in and took the Japanese surrender and then used the defeated Japanese troops as a surrogate UK force to keep order against the mounting indigenous resistance until the 'democratic' Imperial French Army could step back in.

Several emotional semantic slips destroy her attempts at objectivity. Instead of an increase in membership of the Labour party, she gives us “an insurgent grab”. Instead of a “manifesto”, she prefers to call it “siren songs” and the content is just “stuff” that she propagandises as “free”, though they’re fully costed. She also falsely assumes that Marxism failed, whereas Karl Marx never laid out a blueprint for government.<br/><strong> E Jones</strong><br/>Eastington, Gloucestershire</p>',\n",
